For GUI or offline tests of F 63 (`P 06 * (Earned Premium + Remaining Budget Premium)`), use
`NJ_Annual_Prod_202605_Fake` class `PRNJ - PA\PA\MA\Direct Group\BI Total`: P 06 is a quarterly
input (sidecar names `@3`), both premiums are annual Engine vectors (`@12`, stored 1), F 63 is
quarterly. NY MP+PIP and Penn+CT BI Total look the same. Fake **NY BI Total** does not: its P 06
is annual only and F 63 has no CSV, so a quarterly F 63 cannot be built there at all.

**How to apply:** in Arco, change the path bar's state to MA and the last segment to BI Total
(the list scrolls; drag its scrollbar). Saving P 06 with no edit forces the walk. Every save in
that class shows a "Dependent updates" box for G 41 / G 91 / G 92 — Fake-data failures unrelated
to F 63 ([[fake-project-refresh]] plan). Used 2026-09-29 for the
[[calculated-walk-reads-stale-sibling-views]] fix; the evidence script pattern (recompute F 63
from the `@3` files) is in that session's temp/f63_gui_test/snapshot.py.
