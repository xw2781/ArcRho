description: "An empty line in an ArcRho dataset CSV is an origin with no value; pandas drops it by default, which is what produced \"returned 39 values; expected 40\" — every dataset read now goes through helpers.read_dataset_csv"

Every dataset-cache CSV writer emits an **empty line** for a `None` — see
`dfm_service._csv_text`. A method output whose newest origin has no ultimate
yet therefore ends on a blank line, and that line is data: it is the origin,
holding nothing.

`pandas.read_csv` defaults to `skip_blank_lines=True`, so each reader silently
returned one row fewer per empty origin. In `NJ_Annual_Prod_2026 Q3-Aug` the
quarterly `F 23 - Incurred DFM w/ Selected LDFs@3.csv` holds 40 rows with the
40th blank; every reader saw 39, and `F 91 - Current Qtr Indicated` refused to
refresh with *"Source '…' returned 39 values; expected 40"*. A blank row in the
**middle** was worse: it shifted every row after it with no error at all.

**Fix (2026-09-15, Engine + Gateway deployed):** `app_server.helpers.read_dataset_csv`
owns the read — `header=None`, `float_precision="round_trip"`,
`skip_blank_lines=False` — and all eleven dataset-CSV reads call it (DFM, BF,
Cape Cod, Bootstrap, Berquist-Sherman, Result Selection, calculated datasets,
dataset service, runtime roll-up). `skip_blank_lines=False` is a no-op on a
file with no blank rows and never invents a row from the final newline.

**Leading blank (2026-09-27, commit 6f70babd, not yet deployed):** pandas sizes the
frame from the first line, so a file whose **first** origin is empty raised
*"No columns to parse from file"* — a Result Selection with nothing selected for
its oldest year (Fake project HOL `F 91 - Current Qtr Indicated`) broke every
dependent (G 23, F 92, G 12, then G 91/G 92). The helper now passes
`names=range(widest line)` when the first line is blank; a file starting with
data reads exactly as before. The ResQ import writes such origins as `0.0`
while the method JSON says `None`, so the first walk after an import is what
turns them blank.

**How to apply:**
- Never write a bare `pd.read_csv` for a dataset cache CSV; call the helper and
  pass only `dtype`/`keep_default_na` as overrides. Source-table reads (data
  processing, field mapping, table summary) are a different contract and keep
  their own calls.
- "returned N values; expected N+1" means empty origins, not a broken method.
  Compare the file's newline count with what pandas reads to confirm.
