"""The deployed-component model shared by the Build Manager, the build
listener, and the client deploy CLI.

This was extracted from ``arcrho_build_manager`` when builds became remotely
triggerable. The component table, the trees whose edits make a deployed
component stale, and the freshness rule now have one owner, so the GUI a human
drives and the CLI an agent drives can never disagree about which components a
change makes stale — the exact mistake this module is meant to prevent, where
an ``app_server`` edit silently left the Gateway on old code because only the
Bridge and Engine were rebuilt.
