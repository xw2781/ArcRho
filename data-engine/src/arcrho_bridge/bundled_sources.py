"""Repository sources the ArcRho Bridge freezes into its executable.

The Bridge runs this frozen copy rather than the working tree, so an edit to any
of these roots does not reach a running ResQ import until the Bridge is rebuilt.
Two consumers need to agree on the list: ``build_exe.py`` bundles these roots,
and the build manager reports the Bridge as stale when one of them is newer than
the deployed executable. Both read this module so the list cannot drift.

Keep this module free of side effects and of imports outside the standard
library; the build manager imports it without preparing a build environment.
