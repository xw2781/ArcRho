"""Durable, server-local ArcRho dataset-type change.

A project's dataset-type table defines what every dataset instance in that
project is, which of them are calculated, and what each formula refers to. The
Engine applies a change to it on the machine where ``E:\\ArcRho Server`` is a
local drive, because rebuilding what the change re-derives means visiting every
sidecar of every reserving class -- one SMB round trip each from a Client PC,
inside a request the user is waiting on.

Requests queue under ``requests/dataset_types_change/requests`` and are retained
until a validated terminal status exists. Unlike a source refresh, this job
takes the *project-scope* propagation lease rather than a per-class one: the
table it rewrites belongs to no single reserving class. The whole project is
held only while the plan is confirmed and the table written; the lease is then
narrowed to the reserving classes the plan named, and every other class of the
project is writable again while those are rebuilt.

The job runs three stages:

``plan``    the canonical ``dataset_types_plan_service`` recomputes, from each
            class's index, which reserving classes the change reaches, and
            the job refuses to continue unless that matches the plan the user
            confirmed -- an edit made while the dialog was open must be
            reviewed, not silently absorbed into a wider lock.
``table``   the canonical ``dataset_types_service`` validates the submitted
            rows, resolves each row's Source/Generated, and writes the JSON and
            its XLSX companion.
``graphs``  the canonical ``calculated_dataset_service`` rewrites the sidecars
            the plan named -- a renamed type's instances take its new name --
            re-derives their precedents/dependents from the new table,
            recalculates the calculated datasets whose formula or kind
            changed, and walks each affected reserving class's dependents.

Nothing in here is specific to being the Engine: every step calls the same
canonical ``app_server`` service a Client PC would have called, which is what
keeps one implementation of "the dataset type table changed".
