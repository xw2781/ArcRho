# One-way ResQ reserving-class export

The `Export Reserving Class to ResQ` macro
(`python-api/macros/export_reserving_class_to_resq.py`) pushes one ArcRho
reserving class into the identically scoped ResQ reserving class, one way and
in one piece. It is the push counterpart of the
[sync macro](resq_reserving_class_sync.md): the same Bridge queue, the same
canonical session, the same ResQ writer, the same shared baseline, and the
same results window — minus the per-row direction and the signatures. The
review before the write is the one the Import macro also opens; see
[the shared ResQ transfer review](resq_reserving_class_transfer_review.md).

The ArcRho project name is also used as the ResQ project name, and the
selected reserving-class path must exist in that project on both sides. The
UI does not offer a project or path mapping override.

## What is pushed

For the reserving-class path selected in the active Project Instance page,
every item below is written, each after the items it reads:

- **Input datasets** — every sidecar whose `method_type` is `None`, that is
  neither `calculated` nor an `engine` dataset, and that has a CSV cache on
  disk. Triangle and vector values are written cell by cell
  (`SetValuesByIndex`) and the sidecar Notes go into the ResQ `Notes`. ResQ
  takes values at the period lengths a dataset is shown at, so a triangle is
  emptied (`ClearData`), given the sidecar's `stored_development_length`, shown
  at the sidecar's stored pair for the write, and put back to its display pair
  before the save. When ResQ stores the triangle at a different origin length,
  the emptied triangle is also saved and read again (`Save`,
  `UnloadChildren`, re-find) before the shape is restated: `StoredOriginLength`
  has no setter, the origin store follows `OriginLength` while the triangle
  holds nothing, and that is the sequence the ResQ window itself asks for.
  A dataset that is `Calculated` in ResQ is skipped,
  because ResQ recomputes it, even when ArcRho's library treats the type as an
  editable input.
- **DFM methods** — first the structure, so the ResQ DFM matches ArcRho's
  before any value is written: the output vector's dataset type, the input
  triangle, the origin and development lengths (`OriginLength` first, then
  `DevelopmentLength`, keeping ResQ's rule that the development length
  divides the origin length), the Details-tab decimal places as ResQ's Dec
  Places (`RatioDecimalPlaces`, which the import reads back into
  `details_tab.decimal_places`), the number of average rows
  (`RatioAverageCount`), and each row's definition (`AverageType`,
  `WeightType`, `PeriodsIncluded`, `ExcludeHighLow`/`ExcludeHighLow2`,
  `Formula` for a User Calculation row, then `Name`). The rows come from
  `resq_migration.dfm.arcrho_average_rows_as_resq`, the inverse of the
  import's own reading (`resq_average_rows_as_arcrho`): a volume or simple
  row is a custom row named by its label, a benchmark row is type 9, a User
  Entry row holding one formula that names other rows in every ratio column
  is a User Calculation row with that formula as `Average(n)`, and every
  other User Entry row is ResQ's User Entry. Only what differs is written: a
  row is left alone when the import would already read it as ArcRho's row
  (which keeps a ResQ median, pattern or prior-analysis row that ArcRho
  carries as copied values) or when it already holds the definition. An
  output type ResQ does not have is left as it is and named in the result;
  an input triangle ResQ does not have skips the DFM (`missing_input`); a
  structure change ResQ refuses, such as one on a template-implementation
  method, fails the DFM with ResQ's reason and nothing is saved. The
  results window lists the structure changes beside the row, for example
  `Written to ResQ: rows 13 -> 12, input Paid -> Incurred.` Then ratio
  exclusions (`SetExcludedRatios`), User Entry factors
  (`SetUserRatios`, up to the last ratio column), each average row's `- Ult`
  tail factor (`CustomAverages(i).TailFactor`), the selected average per
  column including the tail column (`SetSelectedRatios`), the Curves tab
  (`FutureDevelopmentPeriods`, `FreeFitC`, `SetIncludedRatios`, the User
  Entry columns through `SetCurveColumnDescription` and `SetCurveValues`
  with `DevIndex = 0` for a column's tail, `SetSelectedEstimates` per period,
  `SelectedTailFactor` and `SelectedTailCurve`), and Notes. The sync's
  apply phase uses the same writer, structure step included. `FittingMethod` is never written: ArcRho fits
  by log regression only, so a ResQ method fitted by least squares keeps that
  setting; a ResQ prior-analysis, pattern or benchmark user column keeps
  ResQ's own values, because ResQ refuses a write to one ("You may not set
  user entry values on a non-user entry curve"). An ArcRho user column of
  any kind lands in a ResQ User Entry column as its values and label, so a
  DFM the export creates carries ArcRho's prior-analysis column (found in
  the end-to-end check of 2026-09-23, macro 3.0.1). A ResQ prior-analysis
  ratio row is read-only in the same way ("You cannot set a user value for
  a read-only average"), and a length change clears both it and a
  prior-analysis Curves column to 1.0; the export leaves them, so after a
  length change their values differ from ArcRho's until ResQ's prior
  analysis is re-run. The User Entry factors reach every ResQ User Entry row, those
  named User Entry and those ArcRho names otherwise. After the structure
  and before the values, the first column of every ResQ average formula is
  read; a DFM with
  a formula ResQ cannot evaluate is skipped with that formula named. The read
  covers the `RatioAverageCount` rows the DFM really has, never the phantom
  rows ResQ reports past them.
- **Bornhuetter Ferguson methods** — first the inputs, so the ResQ BF matches
  ArcRho's: the output vector's dataset type, the origin length, the latest
  (a triangle when ResQ holds one by that name, else a vector, with
  `LatestType` to match), percentage developed (`PercentageDeveloped` put
  before `PercentageDevelopedType`, because putting the dataset moves ResQ's
  type; the type is 2, the DFM's cumulative development factors, which is
  what ArcRho reads percentage developed from), and every ArcRho prior in
  ArcRho's order. The priors both lists already share at the front stay with
  their weights; every later ResQ prior is removed from the end
  (`RemovePriorVector`) and the rest of ArcRho's list is added
  (`AddPriorVector(vector, 0)`, ultimates). Then each prior's weight per
  origin where ResQ's differs (`PriorRatioObj(k).SetRatioWeights`, after
  `PriorRatioWeightSelection = 1`, manual weighting; a blank ArcRho weight is
  1), then Notes and a save. Only what differs is written. Every input is
  looked up before anything is written, so a BF whose latest,
  percentage-developed or prior dataset ResQ lacks is skipped untouched
  (`missing_input`), and a change ResQ refuses fails the BF with ResQ's
  reason. The results window lists the input changes, for example
  `Written to ResQ: latest Paid -> Incurred, priors D 82 -> D 82, D 91.`
  The import reads only a BF's first prior (`Prior`), so a BF with several
  priors imports its first one.
- **Result Selections** — the output vector's dataset type, the origin
  length, then the loaded source datasets: every ResQ dataset ArcRho's
  `loaded_datasets` lacks is removed (`RemoveDataset`, which takes the
  dataset object), every ArcRho dataset ResQ lacks is added (`AddDataset`),
  and the method is saved before the weights so they address ResQ's new
  indexes. ResQ orders `Dataset(i)` itself, so weights (`SetWeights`) always
  go through a name-to-index map re-read after the changes. Then
  selected-ultimate overrides (`ClearOverriddenUltimates` + `SetUltimates`)
  and Notes. An ArcRho list with no names removes nothing; a source dataset
  ResQ does not hold is reported and left out. The results window lists what
  was removed and added.
- **B&S Case Reserve Adequacy methods** — the `Avg. Selections` tab and
  Notes. For each development column of both grids the exporter writes the
  `User Value` row (`SetUserAvgInflation`, `SetUserAvgCaseReserves`) and then
  the estimator selected for the column (`SetSelectedAvgInflation`,
  `SetSelectedAvgCaseReserves`), using the ResQ ordinals the import's label
  maps in `resq_migration.extractors` translate from. The method JSON holds
  the `User Value` row as the numbers the page evaluated, with a formula's
  text kept beside them, so a formula-backed cell reaches ResQ as its plain
  value. The method is then saved.
- **Cape Cod and B&S Settlement Rate methods** — Notes
  and a save. The exporter finds the ResQ method by its ArcRho output name,
  writes the Notes of that output sidecar into the ResQ `Notes`, and calls
  `Save()`, so ResQ recalculates it from the datasets and DFMs written before
  it and re-stamps it. No other field is carried across: ArcRho's own
  settings for these methods are not pushed, and a method ResQ does not hold
  is reported as skipped rather than created.

Notes therefore reach ResQ for every kind the export pushes, and always from
the same place — the `notes` of the item's own sidecar, which for a method is
its output sidecar. `\n` line breaks become `\r\n`, because ResQ renders a
`\n`-only value as one line. A sidecar that could not be read carries no
`notes` field at all, and the ResQ Notes are then left untouched rather than
cleared; an empty value that was read does clear them.

Left out, and not shown in the results:

- **Calculated datasets** — propagation recomputes them from their formula
  inputs in ArcRho and in ResQ alike.
- **Engine-generated datasets** (`source_kind: engine`) — ArcRho rebuilds them
  through the Engine and ResQ through its own generator.
- **Bootstrap and Stochastic Consolidation methods** — ResQ has no write path
  for them yet. The import brings a Bootstrap from ResQ into ArcRho (its
  settings and seed, rebuilt from the imported DFM and simulated once), and a
  Stochastic Consolidation (its segments by class path, factors, correlation
  settings, target matrix and seed, consolidated once when every segment
  bootstrap is already in ArcRho), but nothing flows back. A ResQ calculated
  class, such as a Total, imports as an ordinary class: its datasets arrive as
  ResQ's values and none is rebuilt by the Engine.
- **Method output datasets** — they are written through their method, never
  as datasets.

**Methods ResQ does not hold.** A DFM, Bornhuetter Ferguson or Result
Selection that exists in ArcRho but not in ResQ is created, then written
exactly as an existing one is. Nothing else is ever created: a plain dataset,
a Cape Cod, a Berquist Sherman method, a Bootstrap or a Stochastic
Consolidation that ResQ lacks is shown
as `Skipped` (a warning) and left alone, and reaches ResQ through ResQ
itself. The creation follows the sequence the probe confirmed (C1-C4 below):

- **Inputs first.** Every input is looked up before anything is created —
  a DFM's input triangle, a BF's latest, percentage-developed and prior
  datasets, every dataset a Result Selection loads. A method whose input
  ResQ lacks is skipped with that input named (`missing_input`). Because the
  export writes in dependency order, a BF created in the same run finds the
  DFM created just before it: ResQ lists a created object on the writing
  connection straight away.
- **The output type.** The output vector takes the ResQ dataset type named
  by ArcRho's `output_type`. When ResQ has none by that name, it is created
  from ArcRho's dataset-type definition (`dataset_types.json`): its name and
  category, the method's decimal places, as a unique, not aggregated origin
  vector (`DatasetTypes().Add()` starts aggregated). A category ResQ lacks
  skips the method (`missing_category`), as does a type neither side defines
  (`missing_output_type`) or a unique type another vector of the class
  already holds (`output_type_in_use`), which ResQ would otherwise refuse
  with a misleading text.
- **Create and save.** `AddMethod` (1 DFM, 2 BF, 4 Result Selection), the
  method `Name` (ArcRho's `details_tab.name`), the output vector's `Name`
  (ArcRho's output dataset name, the same name unless a DFM's differs), its
  `DatasetType`, then what a save needs — a DFM's input triangle, a BF's
  latest, percentage developed and priors, a Result Selection's datasets —
  and `Save`. A save ResQ refuses fails the method with ResQ's reason, told
  as a category mismatch where ResQ's own text names an unrelated vector, and
  the unsaved method and any type made for it are deleted.
- **Then the rest.** The writer carries on down the existing method's path:
  lengths and average rows, values, selections, Curves, weights, overrides,
  Notes, save.

The results window reads `Created in ResQ.` for such a row (with `new output
type <name>` when the type had to be created too), its header counts the
created methods, and the method is baselined like any written item, so the
next review pairs it with ArcRho's copy instead of calling it new again. The
Sync macro's apply phase uses the same writers but never creates anything.

Datasets that exist in ResQ but not in ArcRho are never touched, because only
ArcRho's inventory is walked. A dataset without a CSV cache, or a
method-owned output sidecar whose method JSON is missing, is shown as
`Skipped` with the reason as well.

## Write order

Items are written in ArcRho's dependency order, the same topological walk
the sync's apply phase uses (`resq_migration.sync_session`). The graph is the
sidecar `precedents`/`dependents` of the whole reserving class, calculated
datasets included, plus the links in each method row's tabs. A row is written
only after every row it reads, wherever that row sits in the inventory; a
calculated dataset is never written, so a row that reads one is written after
the rows that dataset derives from instead. Rows with no link between them
keep a kind order — datasets, then DFMs and Berquist Sherman adjustments,
then Bornhuetter Ferguson and Cape Cod, then Result Selections — and then the
inventory order.

The graph is genuinely needed. In the fake project, `C 92 - Current Qtr
Selected` (a Result Selection of claim counts) feeds the B&S Settlement Rate
adjustment of `Gross Loss--Paid`, whose adjusted triangle `D 18 - BS Paid
DFM` reads, which `D 92 - Current Qtr Selected` loads in turn; the walk writes
them in exactly that order, so each save in ResQ finds its inputs already
written.

Looking through calculated datasets is needed as well. `C 91 - Current Qtr
Indicated` loads `C 62 Reported *(CWOP/Reported) CDF`, a calculated vector
derived from the `C 52 - CWOP/Reported DFM` output. The B&S adjustment above
pulls `C 92` and `C 91` forward in the walk; without the calculated link,
`C 91` was saved before `C 52`, and ResQ marked it "Needs Review" the moment
`C 52` was saved a second later.

## The review table

Before anything is written, the macro runs the queue's `transfer_preview`
phase and opens the shared review table — the same window, columns, and tick
rules the Import macro opens. That window and the selection it remembers are
described once, in
[the shared ResQ transfer review](resq_reserving_class_transfer_review.md).

What is specific to the export:

- The table is opened with **Export Selected to ResQ** and **Cancel**. It is
  the only confirmation asked for; accepting it starts the write.
- The **This Run** column reads `Created in ResQ`, `Overwrites ResQ copy`,
  `Overwrites newer ResQ copy` (the warning, raised only when `ResQ` or
  `Both` changed since the saved pair), or `Not exported`.
- An ArcRho item ResQ does not hold is listed as `ArcRho only`. A DFM,
  Bornhuetter Ferguson or Result Selection can be ticked, reads `Created in
  ResQ`, and is created by the export (see "Methods ResQ does not hold"
  below); anything else cannot be ticked, because the export creates no
  other object in ResQ.
- The ticked names go on the `export` request as `SelectedNames`, narrow the
  rows before the dependency walk orders them, and are saved as the default
  for the next export once the writes are done.
- A comparison that fails is not a gate. The failure is shown with
  `Export Anyway` and `Cancel`, and an `Export Anyway` sends no selection at
  all, so the whole class is pushed exactly as it was before selection
  existed. An unreachable Bridge is reported as such instead, since nothing
  could be published either way.

## No row-by-row review, but a baseline

Beyond that table the export compares nothing and verifies nothing before a
write. Every ticked item is written over the ResQ copy, however recently
ResQ changed it. It is the tool for the moment ArcRho is the source of truth
for a class and ResQ should simply follow; use `Sync Reserving Class with
ResQ` when the two sides need reconciling row by row.

What the export does record, once the writes are done, is the baseline: the
ArcRho and ResQ timestamps each written item ends up carrying. Without it,
ResQ's `Save()` re-stamps every written object and the very next review — this
macro's preview and the sync macro's alike — reports every exported item as
`ResQ changed` or `Both changed`, which is noise, not information.

- **Where** — the same shared document the sync macro keeps, one per project,
  reserving class and ResQ connection, under `projects/<project>/sync/resq/`
  on the ArcRho server (`sync.sync_state_path`). It is server-side and
  scoped to the reserving class, so every user reviews against the same pair;
  no copy of it lives on anyone's machine.
- **What** — one entry per logical item, holding both timestamps and when
  they were recorded (`sync.record_synced_items`). Only an item ResQ
  confirmed as `Exported` or `Saved` is baselined; a skipped or failed one
  keeps its old pair, so the next review still reports the difference.
- **The ArcRho side** is baselined at the values the export actually pushed,
  not at a fresh read, so an ArcRho edit made while the export ran stays
  pending rather than being recorded as delivered.
- **Ripple** — ResQ recalculates whatever reads a written item, which
  re-stamps rows the export never wrote. Those moves are the export's own
  doing, so they are absorbed into the baseline
  (`sync.absorb_propagated_changes`) instead of surfacing as ResQ edits.
- **Failure is never fatal** — the writes are already durable when the
  baseline is saved, so a baseline that cannot be read or written is reported
  in the results header and the export still reports its writes. The next
  review simply falls back to comparing timestamps.

Because the document is shared with `Sync Reserving Class with ResQ`, an
export also settles that macro's next preview for everything it wrote.

## Results window

The results open inside the active Project Instance page as the same nested,
read-only review window the sync macro uses (`ui.reviewTableOpen` with
`host: "projectInstance"` and `selectable: false`): one row per item in write
order, with the type, the logical name, an outcome of `Exported`, `Saved`,
`Skipped`, or `Failed`, and the Bridge's message for the item, under a header
naming the project, the reserving class, the ResQ connection, the counts, and
how many timestamp pairs were saved for the next review to compare against.
The window is non-modal, so it can be minimized to the toolbar while the
class is inspected; the macro keeps running until it is closed.

Before anything is published, the macro refuses while the active nested
window has unsaved changes, since an unsaved edit would not be part of the
export. The review table above is the only confirmation asked for.

## Runtime

ResQ automation exists only where ResQ itself is installed, which is usually
not the machine ArcRho runs on. The macro therefore owns no ResQ session and
reads no reserving-class file: it publishes an `export` request to the same
Bridge queue the sync macro uses (`SyncResQReservingClass`, contract version
4, under `requests\RPC bridge\resq_reserving_class_sync\`), and a
ResQ-connected ArcRho Bridge worker on the Server PC runs
`resq_migration.sync_session.export_reserving_class` on its behalf. The
worker takes the reserving-class job lease a ResQ import and a sync apply
take, so no two of them write one reserving class at the same time, and
connects to ResQ with the shared service account from the server
`config.json`.

The client side is shared with the sync macro: `arcrho_api.resq_sync_queue`
builds, publishes, and waits on the request and refuses before publishing
when no ResQ-connected worker heartbeat is live, and
`arcrho_api.ui.await_review_table` hosts the results window. Any Client PC
can therefore export, provided some machine is running ResQ with ArcRho open.
Inside the app the request is published through the
`resq_sync_request_publish` hosted mutation and its status is polled through
the hosted Bridge-liveness read, so the queue is never touched over the
share; see the transport notes in
[resq_reserving_class_sync.md](resq_reserving_class_sync.md).

The ResQ writer, `ResQReservingClassExporter`, lives in the macro file. The
Bridge freezes that file beside the canonical migration
(`arcrho_bridge/bundled_sources.py`) and loads it as its writer, so an edit to
the exporter or to the session has no effect on an export or a sync until the
Bridge is rebuilt and redeployed. The worker refuses a bundle whose
`SYNC_SESSION_API_VERSION` it was not built against rather than driving it.

For headless use, build a runtime with
`resq_migration.sync_session.build_runtime(migration, exporter_module)` and
call `export_reserving_class(runtime, project_name, rc_path, server_root=...)`
on a machine with ResQ.

## ResQ COM findings

Verified on 2026-08-11 against ResQ connection `JGO_CO1SQLWPV22`, project
`NJ_Annual_Prod_202605_Fake`, when the writer was first built, and still what
the writer relies on:

- 749 read-back comparisons across vector values, DFM
  exclusions/selections/User Entry factors, RS weights, and BF linkage came
  back identical to the ArcRho sources for
  `PRNJ - PA\PA\NY\Direct Group\BI Total`.
- Dataset creation was exercised end to end when the writer was built and
  removed on 2026-08-28: the export never creates a dataset in ResQ. Since
  2026-09-23 it creates a missing DFM, BF or Result Selection, and the output
  Dataset Type one needs (see "Creating and reconfiguring methods").
- The pywin32 write convention for parameterized VBA property puts is
  `Set<Property>(indices..., value)` (e.g. `SetValuesByIndex`,
  `SetSelectedRatios`); it appears nowhere in the ResQ documentation but is
  proven by `python-api/migration/references/ResQToolBox2.py`, the API example
  notebook, and the ArcRho Bridge `SyncDFM` implementation.
- **ResQ names carry stray whitespace.** Real objects exist with trailing or
  doubled spaces, while ArcRho normalized all names on import. A plain
  `collection.Item(name)` misses those objects, so every lookup falls back to
  a cached whitespace-normalized name map.
- **A DFM average formula ResQ cannot evaluate fails inside ResQ, not on the
  connection.** `D 14 - Paid DFM w/ External LDFs` in the fake project fails
  on every path that makes ResQ evaluate its averages: the import cannot read
  `AverageRatioValues` at formula 7 ("Vol + 0.9 - all"), the sync's read-back
  of the selected average fails at column 1, and the export's write surfaces
  as `Access violation at address ... in module 'ResQ3Automation.dll'` from
  `xDFMMethod`. The items written after it on the same connection succeed,
  so reconnecting does not help; the writer probes every formula first and
  skips the DFM (`resq_average_unreadable`) naming the formula to fix in ResQ.
- **`AverageFormula` never ends, so `RatioAverageCount` is the only end of the
  list.** Every DFM of the fake project has 13 average rows, `10: User Entry`
  through `12: User Entry` among them and the reserving class's own
  `13: Aug 2024` below them. Asked for row 14 or beyond, ResQ does not fail:
  it keeps answering `"14: User Entry"`, `"15: User Entry"` and so on out of
  unallocated memory, and evaluating one of those rows crashes in
  `ResQ3Automation.dll` — which skipped every DFM in the class as
  `resq_average_unreadable` until the walk was bounded by the count. The rows
  are read through `RatioAverageCount` by the import and the export alike, and
  both name them through `resq_migration.dfm.resq_average_row_labels`: the
  repeated `User Entry` rows become `User Entry`, `User Entry 2`, `User Entry
  3` in ResQ order, because ArcRho tells its rows apart by label where ResQ
  uses the position.
- **Template-implementation methods are locked.** Structurally changing a
  method that belongs to a ResQ reserving-class template fails with "it is
  part of the ... template implementation". Value and selection writes and a
  plain `Save()` still work.
- **The ArcRho `datasets/` CSV cache is lazy.** A dataset never opened in
  ArcRho has no CSV on disk and is skipped; open it once (or build the cache)
  before exporting.
- **COM collection state is cached per connection.** After `Delete()` the
  item still appears in the same session's collection; a fresh connection
  sees the truth. A created and saved object, on the other hand, is listed
  on the same connection at once (`Item(name)` and a scan both find it, with
  a `Modified` stamp), which is what lets one export create a DFM and then a
  BF and Result Selection that read it, and baseline all three. The exporter
  deletes only an unsaved method whose creation ResQ refused.

## Creating and reconfiguring methods

Probed live on 2026-09-23 with
[`tools/resq_method_config_probe.py`](../../tools/resq_method_config_probe.py)
against `NJ_Annual_Prod_202605_Fake`, class
`PRNJ - PA\PA\All States\Direct Group\COL` (a roll-up class: `Aggregated` and
`Calculated` are both true). Early binding, every result re-read through a
fresh connection (`Disconnect` + `ConnectByName`). The case ids (C1, D2, ...)
are the probe's. These are the calls the export's create and mirror paths
rely on. The DFM calls (D1-D4) are what the export's DFM structure step
writes; a live export of a `ZZ Probe` DFM on 2026-09-23 took it from ResQ's
five default rows to eight ArcRho rows of every kind, then to five with the
lengths 12/12 -> 3/3 and back, changing the input triangle and output type
each way, and every row read back through the import equal to ArcRho's; a
second export of the same payload wrote nothing structural. The BF (B1) and
Result Selection (R1) calls are what the export's BF and Result Selection
writers use; a live export on 2026-09-23 took a `ZZ Probe` BF whose latest,
percentage developed (type 3), and priors had been changed in ResQ, and a
`ZZ Probe` Result Selection with one dataset swapped, back to hand-built
ArcRho payloads (a triangle latest, type 2, priors `D 82` and `D 91` at 0.25
and 0.75, and the three loaded datasets with their weights), read back
equal through the import and through COM; a second export wrote nothing
structural. The create calls (C1-C4) are what the export's create path uses;
a live run on 2026-09-23 created a `ZZ Probe` DFM (six rows of every kind
including a User Calculation), a BF on it with two priors at 0.25 / 0.75,
and a Result Selection loading both at 0.4 / 0.6, each on an output type
made from an ArcRho definition, all read back equal through the import in a
fresh connection and listed with timestamps by the session's closing
inventory on the writing connection. A D-category input with a C-category
output type was refused with the category message and left nothing behind,
and a Result Selection loading a dataset ResQ lacks was skipped before
anything was created.

### Creating a method (C1-C4)

- **`ReservingClass.AddMethod(kind)`** with 1 = DFM, 2 = BF, 4 = Result
  Selection returns the new method with its output vector already attached.
  Before anything is set it reports an empty `Name`, output name and output
  type, `OriginLength` 12, and for a DFM `DevelopmentLength` 12, no input
  triangle and **5 average rows** (`Volume - 1` .. `Volume - 5`). A BF starts
  with `PriorVectorCount` 0, a Result Selection with `DatasetCount` 0.
- **The sequence that saves:** `method.Name`, `method.OutputVector.Name`,
  `method.OutputVector.DatasetType = <xDatasetType>`, the inputs, the lengths,
  then `method.Save()`. ResQ writes `Created: <date> by <user>` into a new
  DFM's Notes.
- **A DFM needs its input first.** `Save` without `InputTriangle` is refused:
  "You cannot save a DFM with no input triangle".
- **A new dataset type:** `project.DatasetTypes().Add()` starts as
  `Unique = True`, **`Aggregated = True`**, `DataFormat = 0`,
  `DecimalPlaces = -1`, no category. Put `Name`, `Category =
  project.Categories().Item(<name>)`, `DataFormat = 1` (origin vector),
  `DecimalPlaces`, `Unique = True` and `Aggregated = False`, then `Save()`.
  Every method output type in the class is `Unique = True, Aggregated =
  False`, so the create path should match that. `Aggregated = True` did not
  itself stop a save.
- **A missing category reads as `None`**, from `Categories().Item(<missing>)`
  and from a name scan alike, so the "category missing" skip of Decision 3 is
  a plain `None` check.
- **Refusals met, all at `Save`, all with a misleading text:**
  - a second vector on a unique type already used in the class: `There cannot
    be more than one "ZZ Probe DFM B" Vector in a Reserving Class` (the vector
    that holds the type);
  - an output type whose **category differs from the input triangle's**:
    `There cannot be more than one "<some vector of the input's category>"
    Vector in a Reserving Class`, for example `"C 52 - CWOP/Reported DFM w/
    Selected LDFs  "` for a D-category type on `Claim Counts--CWP`. Seven of
    the eight mismatched pairs tried were refused; every matched pair saved.
    Real method types share their input's category, so the export will meet
    this only when ArcRho's type is in a different category from its input;
    the result row should then say the category does not match the input
    rather than repeat ResQ's text;
  - the shared, non-unique `F 00 - Ultimate Net Loss` as a DFM's output type
    (a D-category input): refused naming `"D 92 - Current Qtr Selected"`.
  A refused save persists nothing and does not affect later saves on the
  same connection.
- **BF (C3):** `LatestType = 0` (triangle) or `1` (vector) and `Latest`;
  `PercentageDeveloped = <DFM output vector>`, **then**
  `PercentageDevelopedType`. Putting the dataset after the type moved a fresh
  BF's type from 2 to 3; putting the type again restores it. Priors through
  `AddPriorVector(vector, 0)` (0 = ultimates).
- **Result Selection (C4):** `AddDataset(<xTriangle or xVector>)` per dataset.
  **The order of `Dataset(i)` is ResQ's, not the order of the adds:** adding
  the DFM before the BF read back as triangle, BF, DFM, already in memory.
  Address weights through the index re-read after the adds, never by position
  in ArcRho's list.
- **Deleting:** `method.Delete()` removes the method and its output vector
  (no leftover vector), and the dataset type then deletes with
  `DatasetType.Delete()`.

### Reconfiguring a DFM (D1-D4)

- **Input triangle (D1):** a plain `InputTriangle` put. Selections,
  exclusions, User Entry values, rows, the Curves tab and Notes all survive;
  only the curve-fit `IncludedRatios` flags are recomputed.
- **Lengths (D2): put `OriginLength` first, then `DevelopmentLength`.**
  `OriginLength = 3` on an O12/D12 method is accepted and pulls the
  development length down to 3 with it. `DevelopmentLength = 12` on O3/D3 is
  refused ("The development length is incompatible with the origin length");
  `OriginLength = 12` first, then `DevelopmentLength = 12`, works. **A length
  change resets** every selection to ResQ's default row, clears the ratio
  exclusions and the Curves user values, and resets
  `FutureDevelopmentPeriods`. The average rows themselves survive. So the
  existing value writes must run after the structure writes, which is what
  Decision 5's order does.
- **Row count (D3):** `RatioAverageCount` is settable both ways. Growing
  appends ResQ's default rows in its own order (from row 6: `Volume - all`,
  `Vol + 0.9 - all`, `Simple - all`, `Lowest - all` (type 3), `Highest - all`
  (type 4)), then `User Entry` rows (type 5, value 1.0 in every column).
  Shrinking drops rows from the end. Columns the user had selected keep their
  row; columns still on ResQ's default move to the new default row (row 6,
  `Volume - all`). A selection that pointed at a dropped row was not tested,
  because the export writes selections after the rows.
- **Row fields (D4):** every `CustomAverages(i)` field is a plain put:
  `AverageType` (0 custom, 5 user entry, 6 calculated, 9 benchmark),
  `WeightType` (0 simple, 1 volume), `PeriodsIncluded` (**0 = all**),
  `ExcludeHighLow` (bool) with `ExcludeHighLow2` (count), and `Formula` (type
  6 only, `(Average(3)+Average(4))/2`). Every row kind evaluated
  (`AverageRatioValues` answered for each) and read back identically in a
  fresh connection.
- **ResQ renames a row from its fields until it is named explicitly.** After
  the field puts `AverageFormula(i)` read `Simple - all`, `Volume - all`,
  `Simple - 5`, `Volume - 3 Ex hi/lo`, `Simple - 6 Ex hi/lo x2`, `User Entry`,
  `Calculated` and `Benchmark Pattern`; `ResetName()` gives the same default.
  An explicit `Name` put sticks (`ZZ custom label`), survives later field
  puts (`Benchmark` stayed after `Formula` and `PeriodsIncluded` puts), and
  `ResetName()` returns it to the field-derived default. The import reads a
  custom row's weighting, periods and exclusion from the **name**
  (`_infer_avg_settings`), so the export must write the fields first and then
  put ArcRho's label as `Name` on every row.

### Reconfiguring a BF (B1)

- `LatestType = 1` with a vector `Latest`, and back to `0` with a triangle,
  both persist. `PercentageDevelopedType` 2 and 3 both persist.
- **The prior collection holds several vectors.** `AddPriorVector(vector, 0)`
  twice gives `PriorVectorCount` 2. Weights: `PriorRatioWeightSelection = 1`
  (manual), then `PriorRatioObj(k).SetRatioWeights(originIndex, weight)` per
  origin (default weight 1.0). Two priors at 0.25 / 0.75 read back exactly.
- `RemovePriorVector(k)` removes the k-th prior and the later ones move up
  with their weights.
- **The legacy `Prior` is prior 1 of the collection.** It reads
  `PriorRatioObj(1).Vector`, and a `Prior` put replaces that vector, keeping
  its weights. The import reads only `Prior`, so a BF with several priors
  imports its first one.

### Reconfiguring a Result Selection (R1)

- `SetWeights(datasetIndex, originIndex, weight)` persists.
- **`RemoveDataset(<xTriangle or xVector>)`** takes the dataset object, not an
  index (an index raises a type error). The remaining datasets keep their
  weights.
- A re-added dataset goes back where ResQ orders it (here last) with weight 0.
- `SetCustomSortIndex(i, n)` persists `CustomSortIndex(i)` but does not change
  the `Dataset(i)` order, so the order cannot be controlled through COM.

### Load Settings From Another Method (L1)

`targetDfm.LoadMethod(sourceDfm)` (documented as ResQ's "Apply To"), then
`Save`, read back in a fresh connection:

- **Copied:** origin and development lengths, every average row (count,
  names, types, weighting, periods, exclusion, formulas), User Entry values,
  the selected row per column, the ratio exclusions (by position), the Curves
  user columns and values, `FutureDevelopmentPeriods` and the curve-fit
  `IncludedRatios`.
- **Kept:** the name, the output vector and its type, the input triangle, the
  Notes, and `RatioDecimalPlaces` (source 3, target stayed 5).
- **Added:** ResQ appends a line to the target's Notes, `Method settings loaded
  from <class path>\<source> at <time> by <user>`.

This matches Decision 9 of the plan closely: ResQ keeps the ratio decimal
places and writes a Notes line, which Decision 9 does not.

**Confirmed in the ResQ window (2026-09-23, plan step 7).** The Details
tab's "Load Settings From Another Method" button opens "Select an item" (a
class tree, and the chosen class's DFMs by output name). Loading `D 13`'s
copy `ZZ E2E DFM` from `D 23 - Incurred DFM w/ Selected LDFs` and pressing
OK (ResQ then lists the dependents it updates and asks to confirm) copied
what `LoadMethod` copies: every average row, the User Entry values, the
selections, the ratio exclusions and the Curves user values (a User Entry
column took the source's prior-analysis values too). It kept the name,
output, input triangle and `RatioDecimalPlaces` (source 4, target stayed
5), and appended the same `Method settings loaded from ...` line to the
empty Notes. The curve-fit Include flags came out as neither the source's
nor the target's old ones, so ResQ recomputes them for the target's own
triangle. The ResQ window lists only the methods it has loaded: DFMs the
probe's `--gui-setup` had just made through COM did not appear in the
Project Explorer or in "Select an item" until ResQ reloaded, so the check
used an existing DFM as the source instead.

## Unclear / undocumented areas

ResQ COM API:

1. Enum ordinals are undocumented; only `ResQMethodType` 0-4/6-9,
   `ResQDataFormat` 0/1, `RatioExclusionType` 0/1/2, and `PercDevelopedType`
   0-3 are empirically confirmed.
2. `AddMethod` accepts 1-4 in live code; whether it supports Berquist Sherman
   (8/9) or Bootstrap (6) is unknown, which is one reason those are saved
   rather than created.
3. The User Entry average row is documented as row 11; this database has three
   of them, rows 10-12, which ArcRho imports as `User Entry`, `User Entry 2`
   and `User Entry 3`. The writer resolves each row dynamically via
   `AverageFormula` labels, never by fixed index: the row ArcRho holds as
   ResQ's own User Entry goes to the first ResQ User Entry row even when it
   was renamed, and every further User Entry row goes to the ResQ row its
   import name points at.
4. No bulk/SafeArray write path exists; every cell is one COM round trip.
5. There is no explicit `Recalculate`; recalculation appears synchronous on
   property set and on `Save()`, but save-failure semantics (partial
   in-memory state) are undocumented.
6. `Save()` on `Selected` must be isolated per the docs; the writer never
   touches dataset `Selected` flags for this reason.

ArcRho → ResQ mapping gaps of the DFM and Result Selection writers:

7. DFM `excluded == 2` (no data) is never written; ResQ derives empty cells.
8. ArcRho User Entry *formula text* (`average formulas.inputs`) cannot be
   represented in ResQ; only the resolved numeric factor is written.
9. Custom average definitions are matched by label only. An ArcRho-authored
   average whose label does not exist in the ResQ method is skipped for that
   column; creating or reordering ResQ averages via `CustomAverages(i)` is
   untested.
10. ResQ orders a Result Selection's `Dataset(i)` itself, whatever order the
    datasets were added in, and `CustomSortIndex` does not change it (R1);
    weights are addressed through a name→index map rebuilt after the removes
    and adds.
11. Ultimate overrides push ArcRho `ultimate_overrides` as ResQ overridden
    ultimates; non-overridden ultimates are not pushed.
12. On the Curves tab, ArcRho user columns map onto ResQ's by position
    (column 6 onward); `CurveUserValueColCount` is raised when ArcRho holds
    more, never lowered, and a column ResQ types as prior analysis, pattern
    or benchmark is left as ResQ has it; ResQ's column type alone decides,
    so an ArcRho prior-analysis column fills a ResQ User Entry column.
    `SetSelectedEstimates(DevIndex)`
    changes the stored number without moving the tail's selected value, so
    the tail is always written through `SelectedTailFactor` (probed
    2026-09-03). A ResQ Curves tab fitted by least squares is read as
    `fitting_method = least_squares` and shown in ArcRho with its
    log-regression fits.

The Cape Cod field writer remains in the exporter for the sync macro's apply
phase; its known gaps (no scaling type, collapsed prior-ultimate modes) are
the sync documentation's `supported fields only` caveat and do not affect the
export, which only saves Cape Cod methods. The sync's apply phase also uses
the BF writer, but still refuses a BF with more than one prior before any
write, because its read-back checks only the first.
