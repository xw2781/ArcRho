# ArcRho Macro Source

`python-api/macros` is the source of truth for ArcRho macros maintained by agents.

## A macro must stand on its own

A macro runs inside the installed ArcRho app and imports `arcrho_api` from the
copy the app was built with, not from this checkout. Publishing a macro to the
shared library therefore ships the macro file and nothing else: a user picks up
a new macro version straight away, but they keep the `arcrho_api` their app was
built with until the app itself is rebuilt and reinstalled.

So a macro must not depend on a change made in `python-api/src/arcrho_api` in
the same turn. Concretely:

- **Own the behaviour the macro is responsible for.** Wording the macro writes,
  formatting it applies, and rules only that macro follows belong in the macro
  file, even when a similar helper exists in `arcrho_api`.
- **Treat `arcrho_api` as an older library.** Call it for things that have been
  stable for a while. Never call a function you have just changed, and never
  rely on a keyword argument, constant, or return shape you have just added.
- **When a shared contract really must change** — a format two components have
  to agree on, such as the combined-adjustment note lines both the notes macro
  writes and the ResQ import reads — change `arcrho_api` for the reading side,
  and still have the macro produce the new output on its own. Say in the pull
  request that the reading side is live only after the next app build.
- **Test it both ways.** Prove the macro writes what it should when the shared
  helper behaves the old way, as
  `test_generate_notes_for_combined_adjustment.py` does by swapping
  `adjustment_description` for the older implementation.

Symptom to recognise: a macro is published and deployed at its new version, the
tests pass in this checkout, and the app still produces the old result. That is
almost always a macro leaning on a shared helper the installed app has an older
copy of.

## Macro metadata and versions

Every active macro Python file directly in this folder must include these fields in
its `<arcrho-macro>` metadata block:

```text
# Version: 1.0.0
# Release Note: Briefly explain what changed from the previous version.
```

Every active macro must also name the Flight Deck icon it should arrive with:

```text
# Icon: calculator
```

- The value is one short name from the Flight Deck's built-in glyph catalog in
  `frontend/ui/flight_deck/flight_deck_icons.js` (for example `calculator`,
  `document`, `chart`, `download`, `upload`, `sync`, `layers`, `gear`, `table`).
- The name decides only the icon a *new* Flight Deck button starts with, so every
  user who loads the macro from the shared library gets the same button. A user
  who then changes their own button keeps their choice: the icon is stored with
  the button, and the macro never overwrites it.
- A missing name, or one the catalog does not hold, falls back to the glyph for
  the macro's `Scope`.
- `frontend/tests/flight_deck.test.mjs` fails if an active macro here names no
  icon or names one the catalog does not hold.

- Use semantic versions in `major.minor.patch` form.
- `Release Note` must be a short, non-empty, single-line string describing the
  current version's change from the immediately preceding version. For a new
  macro, describe it as the initial release.
- Increment the version whenever the macro code or metadata changes.
- Before replacing an existing version, copy it without modification to
  `backup/<macro-file-stem>/<version>/<macro-file-name>`.
- Archived versions are immutable historical records. They are not active macros
  and must not be deployed to the user macro directory.

The `backup/` directory is only for prior macro versions. Its structure and rules
are documented in `backup/README.md`.

## Retired macros

`archive/` holds macros that were withdrawn from service and are kept only as a
reference copy. They are no longer maintained: do not update them, version them,
deploy them, or publish them. `publish_macro_library.py` reads only the active
`*.py` files directly in this folder, so nothing under `archive/` reaches the
shared library. Retiring a macro also means deleting its published copy from the
shared library, which keeps its own copy under `<library>/archive/`. See
`archive/README.md`.

## Deployment

After adding or editing a macro here, deploy every macro in this folder to:

```text
C:\Users\xwei.PRCINS\Documents\ArcRho\macros
```

Keep the deployed copies byte-for-byte aligned with these source files.
Only deploy the active `*.py` files directly in this folder; do not deploy anything
under `backup/`.

## Shared macro library

`publish_macro_library.py` publishes active macros from this folder to the
official shared server macro library (default `E:\ArcRho Server\shared\macros`,
override with `--library-dir` or `ARCRHO_MACRO_LIBRARY_DIR`). The ArcRho app's
Macro Library window reads that folder so users can copy ("load") macros into
their local macro folder; macros never run from the share directly. Once a
macro is loaded it keeps itself current: the app replaces the local copy
whenever the library holds a strictly newer `Version`, both when the Macros
panel lists macros and again just before one runs, so bumping the version here
and publishing is all it takes to put a fix in front of every user. The same
command also publishes the canonical `python-api/migration` Python modules as
an immutable release under `E:\ArcRho Server\shared\python-api\releases` and
atomically switches `shared\python-api\current.json`; ResQ macros load this
read-only support bundle on Client PCs without a development checkout.

The script validates the `Version`/`Release Note` metadata, archives each
replaced library copy to `<library>/archive/<macro-file-stem>/<version>/`, and
replaces library files atomically. Use `--only <file.py>` (repeatable) to
publish selected macros and `--dry-run` to preview. Keep the library folder
writable by deployers only and read-only for users.

After adding or editing any active macro, always also publish the active
macros to the shared library:

```text
python publish_macro_library.py
```
