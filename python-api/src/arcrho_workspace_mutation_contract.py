"""Contract for Arco Server-hosted workspace mutations.

``arcrho_workspace_read_contract`` hosts reads, whose defining property is that
they are pure functions of the workspace: an uncertain answer may simply be
asked again, or answered locally instead. A mutation cannot borrow that
reasoning, so it gets its own registry and its own route rather than being
smuggled into the read table.

Only allowlisted kinds may execute remotely, and every registered kind must
either be **idempotent** -- running it twice against the same workspace leaves
the end state of running it once, so an answer the client never saw is either
already applied or safe to ask for again -- or be marked ``receipt``. A receipt
kind (create, rename or delete a project folder, a registry save checked
against the revision it read) could not be run twice safely, so the Gateway
keeps one receipt per signed user and request id: the first run records its
outcome, and a repeat of the same request under that id answers from the
receipt instead of running again, while a different request under the same id
is refused with 409. For a receipt kind the request id names the user's action,
not the HTTP attempt, so a retry after a lost answer reuses it. Receipts live
beside the hosted-save receipts and expire with them. Anything that needs an
Engine claim belongs on the hosted-save path
(``arcrho_hosted_save_http_contract``).

What the client may *not* do is fall back to its own mapped drive after the
server may already have acted. Reads fall back freely; a mutation whose outcome
is unknown must be reported, not repeated somewhere else, because the second
run would answer about a workspace the first one already changed.

Mutations run under the submitting user's identity so the audit trail, sidecar
stamps, and log lines name the person who asked rather than the Gateway's
service profile.
