"""Canonical vocabulary, policy, and reader for persisted audit entries.

Every ArcRho dataset sidecar carries an ``audit_log``: one entry per durable
write, naming when it happened, which action produced it, and who ran it. The
entries are appended by the per-method output-sidecar builders in this package
(``build_dfm_output_sidecar`` and its siblings), by the engine sidecar
builder, and by the dataset writers in the app server. The project-level
``audit_log.json`` is the same kind of log at project scope.

Two kinds of writer share that log. A person saving an object records
``Insert``/``Update``; an automation that rewrote the object without anyone
opening it -- the Engine dependent-propagation walk re-publishing a method
whose precedent moved -- records ``Auto Refresh``. Telling those apart is what
lets a reader name *what* changed an object rather than only *when*, so the
action names and that classification live here once instead of being repeated
as literals at every producer and consumer.

There is one policy for every log, and it lives here so no writer can keep a
private one: every action is kept, a run of consecutive automatic entries
collapses to its most recent member (a propagation walk that republishes the
same output ten times is one fact, not ten), and the log is capped at
:data:`DATASET_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_ENTRIES` records for a dataset and
:data:`PROJECT_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_ENTRIES` for a project, oldest dropped first.
