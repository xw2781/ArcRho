"""Contract for Arco Server-hosted workspace reads.

A Client PC that opens a reserving class, a cached dataset, a method window, or
the Project Settings table summary pays one SMB round trip per file it touches,
and a stale reserving-class index makes it open every sidecar and method JSON in
the class over the mapped drive. The app server can instead ask the machine-wide
Arco Gateway to run the very same ``app_server`` service function on the
server host, where the workspace is local disk, and return the service's
response verbatim.

Only the allowlisted kinds below may execute remotely. Each kind names the
canonical service function and the keyword arguments a client may pass, so the
Gateway needs no second table of its own and a new read reaches HTTP the moment
it is registered here. The read kinds are pure functions of the workspace plus
their arguments: a repeated request is safe, so this transport keeps no
idempotency receipt.

Reads run under the submitting user's identity for the same reason hosted saves
do: a load that performs a one-time on-disk upgrade stamps that user, not the
Gateway's service profile.
