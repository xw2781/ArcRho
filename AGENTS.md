# AGENTS.md

This is the ArcRho monorepo root. Use one Git repository here for all ArcRho components.

## Repository Layout
- `frontend/`: current ArcRho desktop/web UI, Electron host, backend service code currently bundled with the frontend app, docs, release fragments, and frontend-specific agent rules.
- `python-api/`: Python API, ResQ migration scripts, migration references, and macro source files.
- `data-engine/`: ArcRho data-engine component.
- `tools/`: repository-level automation, including commit/push helpers for agents.

## Project Terms and Abbreviations
- **DSV (Dataset Viewer):** the frontend workspace for viewing and editing datasets under `frontend/ui/dataset_viewer`.
- **DFM (Development Factor Method):** the frontend workspace for creating and reviewing development factor methods under `frontend/ui/method_pages/dfm`.
- **BF (Bornhuetter Ferguson):** the frontend workspace for Bornhuetter Ferguson methods under `frontend/ui/method_pages/bornhuetter_ferguson`.
- **RS (Result Selection):** the frontend workspace for result selection methods under `frontend/ui/method_pages/result_selection`.
- **PI (Project Instance):** the frontend workspace for browsing and working within a project instance under `frontend/ui/project_instance`.
- **PS (Project Settings):** the frontend workspace for configuring project settings under `frontend/ui/project_settings`.

## Mandatory Read Before Editing
Before changing files under `frontend/`, read `frontend/FRONTEND_AGENT_GUIDELINES.md`.

## Single Source of Truth (MUST)
Before changing code, configuration, schemas, data contracts, automation, documentation, or tests, identify the canonical owner of every value and rule.
- Define each value or rule once. Consumers must import, read, derive, generate from, or delegate to that source; clearly model legitimate runtime overrides and derived values.
- When direct reuse across languages or build boundaries is impractical, use one canonical machine-readable source and generate validated adapters or artifacts so drift is detected.
- Tests may assert canonical behavior, but fixtures, expected values, generated documentation, and inventories must not become competing sources of truth.
- When the touched area already contains duplication, consolidate it within the task's safe scope and remove obsolete copies. Ask before cleanup that broadens behavior or compatibility risk.

## Bug Fix Verification and Cleanup
Before changing code for a bug fix, review the relevant code and verify that its current logic can explain the bug or unexpected behavior reported by the user. If the reported behavior cannot be traced to the code, or if any material detail is uncertain, stop and ask the user for more details or clarification until the issue is clear. Do not make assumptions or guesses when deciding on code changes.
When fixing a bug, remove clearly obsolete code in the touched area. Ask before broader cleanup or cleanup with behavior risk.

## ArcRho JSON Contract Skill
Use `$arcrho-json-contract` when refining dataset JSON sidecars/sidercars, reserving-class `index.json`, data storage formats, JSON field names or structures, ResQ migration behavior, or `python-api/migration/resq_data_migration.py` output.

## ArcRho Macro Source
Treat `python-api/macros` as the source of truth for ArcRho macro files maintained in this repository.
Follow the macro metadata, versioning, release-note, and backup rules in `python-api/macros/README.md` whenever adding or changing a macro.
When adding or editing a macro, update the file in `python-api/macros` first, then copy all active macro files from that folder to `C:\Users\xwei.PRCINS\Documents\ArcRho\macros`.

## Python Runtime Preference
Always prefer Python 3.10 for this repository. When validating Python code, running scripts, installing dependencies, or creating virtual environments, use a Python 3.10 interpreter unless the user explicitly asks for another version or a toolchain requires a different runtime.

## Node Runtime Preference
The frontend includes a bundled portable Node runtime. When validating or running Node/npm commands for this repository, prefer `frontend\node-portable\node.exe` and `frontend\node-portable\npm.cmd` instead of plain `node` or `npm`, because Node is not expected to be installed globally or available on `PATH` in the agent environment. Do not report "Node is not installed in this environment" unless the bundled portable runtime is also missing or fails.

## Validation Runtime Limit
No validation command should run for more than 60 seconds by default. Use targeted fast checks first, and put tests, docs checks, syntax checks, and smoke checks behind a timeout of 60 seconds or less. If a broader validation is expected to exceed 60 seconds, ask before running it and explain why the longer run is needed. When a validation times out, stop it and report the timeout instead of retrying indefinitely.
Validation commands must not write files to the C drive. If temporary files are needed, write them only inside the current repository folder.

## Final Response Changed Files
After each task, include a `Changed files` section in the final response with a clickable link to every file the agent changed during that task. Include implementation files, documentation, release fragments, generated files, tests, configuration, and repository instruction files; do not omit non-code changes. Use absolute workspace paths in Markdown links, with an optional line number when it helps identify the relevant change. If the task did not change any files, state `Changed files: none`.
Before writing the final response, check the line count of every changed code file, excluding generated and vendored artifacts, against nearby files and the component's normal organization. If any changed code file is unusually large, explicitly tell the user which file and its line count, explain that its size may increase maintenance risk, and recommend a focused refactor; do not perform that broader refactor unless it is already within the requested scope.
