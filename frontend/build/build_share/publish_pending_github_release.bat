REM Publishes an already-built installer to GitHub Releases without rebuilding it.
REM
REM Use this to seed the GitHub Releases history after a build produced an
REM installer but failed at its publish step. From that point on the normal
REM build derives its next version number from this history, so a version that
REM shipped but was never published to GitHub would otherwise be rebuilt.
REM
REM Usage:
REM   publish_pending_github_release.bat [version] [product]
REM   publish_pending_github_release.bat --check
REM
REM Defaults to ArcRho 1.2.5. Safe to re-run: an existing release is updated in
REM place rather than duplicated.

REM --check reports the resolved paths and publishes nothing. Accept it in any
REM position so a check never turns into a real publish.
