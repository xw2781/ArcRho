"""The whole dependency graph of one reserving class, for the Dependency Graph window.

Every object in a class - an input dataset, a calculated or Engine-built one,
and the output dataset each method publishes - is a row of the class index and
owns a sidecar whose ``precedents`` name what it is computed from. The index
is therefore the node list, with the type, method, status, and formula each
node is drawn with, and the sidecars are the edge list. Nothing is derived
from method JSON here: a method's inputs are already written into its output
sidecar when the method is saved, which is the same graph every dependent
walk follows.

An Engine-built dataset is the one node whose formula the index cannot carry:
an Engine sidecar holds none by contract, and the project Dataset Types own
it. The graph reads those types once and hydrates the engine nodes from them,
so the window can tell a dataset the Engine filled from one source column
apart from one it evaluated as a formula over other types.
