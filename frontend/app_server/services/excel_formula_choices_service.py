"""The lists the Excel add-in offers while a formula is being written.

The Insert Function panel, Select Datasets, and Load Reserving Classes all pick
from the same three lists: the registered projects, one project's reserving
classes, and that project's dataset types. They are answered by one hosted
read, so Excel pays a single round trip for all three and keeps them for the
session. Each list keeps its existing owner; this module only gathers them.
The answer also names the latest project, which Connect and Login offers as a
new workbook's default project.
