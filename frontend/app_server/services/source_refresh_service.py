"""Client-side submission and status for Engine-hosted source-table refreshes.

Importing a project's source table used to run in whatever process the user
clicked in. On a Client PC that meant copying the external CSV through the
client -- read from one share, written to another -- then reading the whole
master copy back to count its rows, and finally rebuilding the table summary
and reserving-class values over the same mapped drive. This module replaces
that with a durable job: the request is published for the ArcRho Engine, which
does all of it on local disk, and the client only polls the status.

The job optionally continues into the project's dependency graph, regenerating
every engine-built dataset instance and walking the calculated datasets and
methods that depend on them. That part has no client-side equivalent at all --
it is the step that used to be left to whoever next opened each object.

Submission is idempotent by ``request_id``: the client generates the id before
its first POST and reuses it on every retry, so a response lost in flight can
never produce a second refresh.
