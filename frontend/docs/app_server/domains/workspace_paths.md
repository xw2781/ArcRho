# App Server Domain: workspace_paths

## Purpose
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Server profile creation and folder inspection treat the supplied folder as an alias, without requiring it or its projects directory to be mounted. Gateway health and Windows enrollment validate the connection; an empty folder is still refused. Startup does not resolve the project folder through the filesystem.
Runtime workspace path read/update domain, and the server profiles: the servers this PC knows, which one is active, and each one's Gateway sign-in.

## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Used by the shell root-path settings modal and the Server tab (`ui/server/`).
- Triggers `config.refresh_runtime_paths()` and clears absolute-path runtime caches on updates.
- After persisting a Server Connection, retries automatic Gateway sign-up for a user who has no local credential and returns its outcome under `enrollment` (`not_configured` when no address is known, `unavailable` with a reason, `enrolled` or `existing`); the dialog stays open with the reason unless it signed up. The save accepts `gateway_url`, stored on the active profile, and `GET /workspace_paths` returns it.
- `GET /workspace_paths` reports whether the AppData config file already exists so the shell can detect first-time setup.
- `GET /server_profiles` lists every saved server with its folder, credential file, the credential's user, Gateway address (read from that credential, or from the profile's own `gateway_url` before the first switch creates it) and whether the credential exists, marks the active one, returns under `current` the server this process actually uses, and reports under `set_at_launch` any root, credential or address fixed by `ARCRHO_SERVER_ROOT`/`ARCRHO_RUNTIME_SERVER_ROOT`/`ARCRHO_GATEWAY_CONFIG`/`ARCRHO_GATEWAY_URL`, so a page can show that server read-only.
- `GET /server_profiles/health?id=<profile>` asks that server's Gateway `/api/health` from the app server with the short capability timeout and returns `ok` plus a reason; without an `id` it asks about this process's own server. The Server tab uses it for each row's dot, so the page never contacts a Gateway itself.
- `GET /server_profiles/inspect?root=<folder>` checks a folder is a server root (it holds `projects`) and returns its resolved path and its leaf name as a suggested server name. It writes nothing and never reads the folder's `config\arcrho_gateway.json`, which is server-only since 2026-09-27; the person adding the server types its address.
- `POST /server_profiles` adds a server (or replaces the one with the same `id`; without an `id` one is derived from the name) with its `gateway_url`. The folder must hold a `projects` folder.
- `POST /server_profiles/activate` makes one server active. When the active server changes, the response carries `restart_required: true` and the caller restarts the app the way File > Restart does (`restartApplication` in `ui/shell/app_lifecycle.js`). The route refreshes runtime paths, clears path caches, and signs up at the new server's address when that server's credential does not exist yet, but restarts nothing itself.
- Both profile writes are refused with 409 while a launch override is set, because they would change the per-machine file the production app reads.
- `POST /server_profiles/sign_in` signs this process's own server in again, for a credential the server refuses: it runs the Windows sign-up at `ARCRHO_GATEWAY_URL`, else the active profile's `gateway_url`, else the credential's own address (`arcrho_api.hosted_save_enrollment.sign_in_again`), and replaces the credential file this process uses (the `ARCRHO_GATEWAY_CONFIG` override included, so a launch-time session may use it) only after the new secret has arrived. The server id the old credential signed up with is kept; a Gateway reporting another is refused with 409 before sign-up, a silent one is 503, and a failed handshake is 502 with its reason, each leaving the old file untouched. It then clears the capability cache, the only per-process state tied to the credential (the credential itself is read per request), so the next request uses the new one without a restart. Returns the listing plus `signed_in` (`user`, `url`, `path`).
- `GET /server/status` reports a refused sign-in as `answering: false` with the "Sign in to the server again" message rather than "Gateway not answering".
- `GET /server/status` carries `control`: whether this process's server may be started and stopped from this PC (`available`), why not (`detail`), and the roles that covers (`roles`: orchestrator, engine, gateway).
- `POST /server/start` and `POST /server/stop` act on this process's own server and are refused with 409 unless its folder is on a fixed disk of this PC and is not production (`arcrho_server_control.control_refusal`). Start clears those roles' stop switches (`apps.<role>.kill_all`) and, unless an Orchestrator heartbeat is live, launches `<root>pps\ArcRho Orchestrator\ArcRho Orchestrator.exe` through `start`, so it is not in the app server's process tree and survives the app's exit; it gets `ARCRHO_ROOT=<root>` and none of this process's root or credential overrides. Stop sets the switches and returns at once with `stopped` (whether no live heartbeat remains); the page follows the heartbeats. No process is ever killed. `tools/local_server.py` uses the same module.

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Persists config in `%APPDATA%\ArcRho\workspace_paths.json`.
- Server profiles live in the same file (`profiles`, `active_profile`) and `workspace_root` mirrors the active one. A file with no list reads as one `default` profile, and nothing is written until a profile or Server Connection save. `arcrho_api.config` owns the shape; `app_server/services/server_profile_service.py` adds only what the app shows and does on a switch.
- Each profile's credential comes from `arcrho_api.config.profile_gateway_config_path`: `arcrho_gateway.json` for `default`, `arcrho_gateway.<id>.json` otherwise, unless the profile names a file. `app_server/config.get_gateway_config_path` and `arcrho_api.gateway` both resolve it through `arcrho_api.config.gateway_config_path`, after the `ARCRHO_GATEWAY_CONFIG` override.
- ArcRho Server Components Setup can optionally set this root for the installing Windows user by calling the canonical `arcrho_api.config.set_server_root`; it does not maintain a second installer-specific workspace setting.
- Uses built-in defaults until Server Connection is saved. Only `POST /workspace_paths` creates that file, so a fresh client install runs entirely on the defaults.
- Resolution order is owned by `arcrho_api/config.py` and shared with the Python API and macros: `ARCRHO_SERVER_ROOT`/`ARCRHO_RUNTIME_SERVER_ROOT`, then the config file, then the packaged default root. `app_server/config.py` adds only the Arcode-mode AppData branch and `paths` normalization.
- `GET /workspace_paths` is also how a macro process outside the app discovers the workspace root when no config file exists.
- Clears the in-memory dataset registry after updates so stale dataset IDs do not keep writing to the previous workspace root.
- ArcRho also attempts sign-up during app startup. It creates the active profile's credential (`%APPDATA%\ArcRho\arcrho_gateway.json` for the default profile) only when an address is known (`ARCRHO_GATEWAY_URL`, else the active profile's `gateway_url`), that Gateway's capabilities offer `windows_enrollment` and report the active folder's server id, and its `POST /api/enroll` Windows handshake returns this user's secret (`arcrho_api.hosted_save_enrollment.enroll_once`). The server's registry is never read; existing local files are never overwritten.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Add config field: update schema + router serialization + config readers.
2. Rename config fields by updating producers, consumers, and docs together.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Invalid path config writes can impact all path-dependent domains.
- Adding a resolution step here without adding it to `arcrho_api/config.py` reintroduces the split where the app resolves a root but macros raise `InvalidArcRhoServerError`.
