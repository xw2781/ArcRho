## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Used by project settings dataset types panel and dependent flows.
- `POST /dataset_types` never performs the long rebuild inside the request. It answers with `applied: "direct"` for a change that re-derives nothing outside the table; with `applied: "plan"` for one that does, carrying `plan` (`table_digest` plus one `affected` entry per reserving class: `project`, `reserving_class`, `instances`, `adopting`, `renaming`, `reason`), the `rows` to submit (formulas naming a renamed type already rewritten), the normalized `renames`, `changed_types` and `classes_total`; or with `applied: "job"` plus `job.job_id` once the same request is posted again with that `plan` (or at once when the plan names no class and renames nothing). `GET /dataset_types/change_job/status?project_name=&job_id=` then reports that job's `status`, `progress`, `result` and whether the project is still `busy`.
- The request carries `renames: [{from, to}]` for every Name the grid edited since the last save. A rename is accepted only when `from` was in the saved table and is gone and `to` is new; anything else is a `400`.
- `GET /dataset_types` keeps normalized 5-column `data.columns/data.rows` for compatibility and also returns `data.source_by_name` (dataset name -> Source expression) derived from project `dataset_types.json`.
- `POST /dataset_types/import_local_file` parses local `.json`/`.xlsx` Dataset Types files for UI-side local import; for `.xlsx`, parser assumes one sheet and the header exactly matches JSON column layout (supports 5-column local format, 6-column persisted format with trailing `Source`, or 7-column persisted format with trailing `Source` and `Generated`).
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Persists dataset type definitions under project folders.
- `POST /dataset_types` saves both `dataset_types.json` and same-folder `dataset_types.xlsx` with matching columns/rows (`Name`, `Data Format`, `Category`, `Calculated`, `Formula`, `Source`, `Generated`); XLSX header row is bold and column widths are auto-sized from header + cell contents (bounded min/max).
- `GET /dataset_types` source metadata extraction is backward-compatible with legacy files: `source_by_name` reads from a `Source` column when present or falls back to row index 5 for older row layouts.
- `POST /dataset_types` recomputes the persisted `Generated` flag from each row's saved `Source`: it is `true` only when the source is non-empty and every non-operator component is covered by a `field_name` in project `field_mapping.json`.
- A change is classified before anything is written. It needs the Engine job when a type was renamed or disappeared, when a surviving type's `Data Format`, `Calculated`, `Formula` or `Generated` moved, or when the components a calculated formula resolves to changed. Everything else -- Category, row order, and **adding an ordinary dataset type** -- is written directly by the app server, because a new type has no instances and no sidecar naming it.
- A change that needs the job is *planned* first by `dataset_types_plan_service.plan_dataset_types_change`, hosted on the Gateway through the `dataset_types_change_plan` workspace read when one is up. The planner takes no lock. From the two tables alone it works out which types the change reaches -- renamed, changed, removed, their direct precedents (whose `dependents` lists move) and every type downstream of them -- then reads one `index.json` per reserving class (through `dataset_instance_index_service.get_index`, so a stale index is rebuilt from its folder, never trusted) and keeps the classes holding an instance of any of those types. The only sidecars it opens are the instances a rename would also rename, to learn whether anything reads them. The plan's `table_digest` is a hash of the five graph-bearing cells of the saved table.
- A renamed type's instances take the new type name (`adopting`). An instance that is a plain dataset, is named exactly after the old type, and has no `dependents` is also renamed with it (`renaming`): its CSV keeps everything after the name, its sidecar file moves, each precedent's `dependents` entry follows, and its runtime cache provenance is dropped so the next open re-validates the cache. A method output keeps its name because its method names it; an instance something reads keeps its name because that reader names it.
- The last condition is not theoretical here: a formula is tokenized against the set of known dataset-type names, and this project's names contain operators. Adding `Total - CWOP` makes the unquoted formula `Total - CWOP` resolve to that one dataset instead of a subtraction, so the components of every calculated formula are recomputed under both name sets and compared. That comparison is pure string work on rows already in hand, which is what lets the common case stay instant instead of being refused on suspicion.
- Removing a dataset type is refused, before the table is written, while any instance of it is still read by a dataset or method that is not itself being removed (`calculated_dataset_service.find_dataset_type_removal_blockers`, which opens only the instances the plan found). A calculated formula naming a removed type is already refused earlier by `require_resolvable_formulas`; this covers the other half, the instances and their downstream readers. An instance nothing reads is not a blocker, so an unused type can always go.
- The job is Engine-hosted under `arcrho_dataset_types_change_contract` (contract version 2: `Rows`, `Renames`, `ChangedTypes`, `Plan`). Submission preflights a live Engine, that no project-scope job already runs, that no reserving class of the project is still being walked, and that no source refresh holds the project; it then publishes a queued status and the request and returns. ArcRho Engine claims the project-scope propagation lease, **recomputes the plan** with the same planner and refuses with "the project changed since you reviewed this change" unless `plans_match` -- same table digest, same classes, same counts; the reason text is not compared -- then writes `dataset_types.json` and `dataset_types.xlsx` through the same `dataset_types_service.apply_dataset_types_rows` the direct path uses, appends the audit entry, and **narrows the lease** to the affected classes (`narrow_project_scope_lease`). Only then does `calculated_dataset_service.apply_planned_dataset_types_change` rewrite the sidecars the plan named, re-derive their `Precedents` and `Dependents`, recalculate the changed calculated dataset types, walk each affected class's dependents and rebuild each affected class's index.
- While the lease holds the whole project -- from the claim until the table is written, seconds -- `find_reserving_class_propagation_hold` reports `{"reason": "project"}` for every class of the project. Once narrowed it reports that only for the classes the plan named; every other class is writable, which is safe because anything created there from then on is created against the new table. `find_project_scope_propagation_hold` keeps reporting the job throughout, so no second project-wide job or source refresh can start beside it. A partially failed rebuild is a terminal `error` whose message says the table was saved, because the table is already the new one.
- The job's `progress` is counted in reserving classes while it recomputes the plan (stage `scanning`, one unit per class), then in the dataset instances the plan named (one unit each), plus one unit for the table write and one per reserving class the change makes the walk revisit. Its `result` reports `datasets_total` (the instances the plan named), `datasets_updated`, `datasets_renamed`, `classes_total` (the project's), `classes_affected`, `classes_walked` and `datasets_recalculated`.
- Save validation treats calculated formulas as valid when referenced components resolve to Dataset Type `Name` values; it no longer requires field-mapping source resolution for those components. Both paths run it before anything is written, and the Engine runs it again before it writes.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Add type metadata field: align schema, service normalization, and frontend editor.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Type schema drift can break downstream interpretation logic.
- A change that needs the job cannot be applied while ArcRho Engine is unavailable. That is deliberate: the table and everything derived from it must move together, and a Client PC cannot hold the project while it does.
