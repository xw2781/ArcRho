# App Server Domain: DFM RPC Bridge

## Purpose
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
DFM RPC bridge routes create request files for remote data-engine DFM owned-state sync, compare local and returned metadata, apply an approved owned patch through the canonical DFM v2 calculator/save service, finalize keeping local JSON without sending a `SyncDFM` request, and send confirmed write-back requests to the RPC server through `arcrho_bridge`.

## Entry Points
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
Routes:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/dfm/rpc-bridge/sync` | Write `Function = DFM` request, wait up to the requested timeout for remote DFM JSON, and return comparison metadata plus local/remote JSON snapshots. |
| `POST` | `/dfm/rpc-bridge/compare` | Compare current local and remote DFM JSON file metadata without sending a request, returning the same snapshot fields. |
| `POST` | `/dfm/rpc-bridge/apply` | Validate the remote owned-patch marker, merge approved owned components over the newest local derived snapshot, canonically recalculate/save v2, return the saved payload for frontend reload, and delete the temporary response. |
| `POST` | `/dfm/rpc-bridge/keep-local` | Keep the local DFM JSON unchanged after `Keep Using Local` and delete the remote RPC JSON without writing a `SyncDFM` request. |
| `POST` | `/dfm/rpc-bridge/cleanup` | Delete temporary remote DFM JSON and `SyncDFM` status JSON for the current project/reserving-class/method after the sync dialog is dismissed or a pending sync returns after dismissal. |
| `POST` | `/dfm/rpc-bridge/update-remote` | Require explicit RPC server write confirmation, write `Function = SyncDFM` request with the local method JSON path, wait for the `SyncDFM...json` status response, return pass/fail message, and delete the stale remote RPC JSON. |

## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Before writing each `Function = DFM` request, the app server deletes any existing returned DFM JSON and `SyncDFM` status JSON for that project/reserving-class/method from `projects/<project>/data/<ReservingClassFolder>/methods/tmp_rpc`, so the sync comparison can only use a fresh RPC bridge response. `Function = DFM` request files contain Details page fields plus `DataPath`, where `DataPath` points to the expected returned remote DFM method JSON under that RPC temp folder.
- `Function = SyncDFM` request files contain the same Details page fields plus `DataPath`, where `DataPath` points to an expected `SyncDFM...json` status file. They also include `MethodJsonPath` for the local DFM JSON to write into the RPC server and `RPCServerWriteConfirmed = true`; the app-server route rejects update-remote requests without this explicit confirmation. When the local output sidecar is readable, the request also carries its `notes` value as `MethodNotes` — including an empty value — because Method Notes are not stored in the method JSON the bridge reads; the field is omitted only when the notes owner is unavailable.
- Request files are flat JSON `request-*.json` payloads with native booleans/numbers. Temporary `.tmp` files are atomically renamed to `.json`, and `arcrho_bridge` scans JSON requests only.
- `SyncDFM` status JSON must include fields that let the frontend report final result, for example `ok`, `status`, and `message`.
- `arcrho_bridge` handles confirmed `SyncDFM` requests by reading `MethodJsonPath`, writing excluded ratio cells, User Entry average-formula values with `SetUserRatios`, and selected average formula indexes with `SetSelectedRatios` to the RPC server DFM method, calling `Save()`, and writing the status JSON to `DataPath`. ResQ exposes DFM cell notes as a read-side `CellNotes` string, so RPC bridge imports them into returned DFM JSON and local apply syncs them, while remote write-back leaves existing ResQ cell notes unchanged until a safe per-cell setter is available.
- A DFM read response also carries ResQ method-level `Notes` as transient `method metadata.method notes`. The comparison shows it as a Method Notes diff against the local output-sidecar `notes` value, and a confirmed remote-to-local apply writes the present remote note into the output sidecar, which remains the only persisted ArcRho owner — an empty ResQ note clears the sidecar notes. Only an absent `method notes` field (an older bridge payload) keeps the local sidecar notes. A confirmed `SyncDFM` write-back sets ResQ method `Notes` from the request's `MethodNotes` with line breaks normalized to `\r\n` (ResQ renders `\n`-only text as one line) — an empty `MethodNotes` clears ResQ method `Notes`, an absent field leaves them unchanged, and the status JSON reports the write under `updated["method notes"]`.
- A DFM read response uses `payload format = arcrho-dfm-owned-patch-v1` and contains only RPC-owned settings. It is not a complete v2 method and must never be persisted directly. Compare responses still project exclusions, average definitions/selections, cell notes, and other owned components for the review dialog.

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Local DFM method JSON path: `projects/<project>/data/<ReservingClassFolder>/methods/DFM@<Name>.json`.
- Remote DFM method JSON path: `projects/<project>/data/<ReservingClassFolder>/methods/tmp_rpc/DFM@<Name>.json`.
- Remote update status JSON path: `projects/<project>/data/<ReservingClassFolder>/methods/tmp_rpc/SyncDFM@<Name>.json`.
- `<ReservingClassFolder>` and `<Name>` use the shared reversible `_%XX_` filename escaping rule for Windows-invalid filename characters.
- Applying a remote patch delegates to the same owned projection and preview/save contract used by normal DFM v2 saves. Embedded input/basis snapshots, calculated ratios/averages, ultimates, source revisions, and publication metadata always come from the canonical local base and recalculation.
- Sparse RPC fields are interpreted through the canonical DFM owned-state projection. Supported Details settings, exclusions, formula definitions/selections/inputs and owned stored values, ratio-cell notes, and Ratio Basis selection are applied when present; omitted owned fields retain their local values. Method Notes are not part of the owned method projection: apply writes a non-empty `method metadata.method notes` value to the output sidecar `notes` field only.
- `json format`, embedded source snapshots, derived arrays, revisions, and absolute paths are never accepted as RPC-owned fields. The apply response reports the fields that were actually applied; a sparse patch does not produce a competing required-component list.
- JSON request files are kept for audit/debug. Returned RPC bridge JSON files are deleted before each new sync request, after the user completes the final action, closes the sync review window without choosing an action, or closes the window while a pending sync later returns.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Change DFM request-file contract: update schema/service, frontend client payloads, and this domain doc.
2. Change comparison actions: update `dfm_rpc_bridge_dialog.js`, `dfm_rpc_bridge_client.js`, and route behavior.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Request and return-path filename rules must match data-engine expectations exactly.
- Timestamp comparison uses the canonical `last modified` value inside each DFM JSON file. Timezone-less ResQ metadata is parsed as UTC so a value like `2026-06-05 15:23:59.777` compares equal to the matching ArcRho ISO value `2026-06-05T15:23:59.777Z`.
- Sync waits are intentionally short; timeout handling must remain clear to users.
