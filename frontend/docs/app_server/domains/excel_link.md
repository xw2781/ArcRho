## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Called by the Project Instance Excel Link Manager, which runs as a nested pi-window page (`ui/project_instance/excel_links_window.html`) pinned to one reserving class. See [`docs/ui/project_instance.md`](../../ui/project_instance.md).
- Neither route touches a workbook in the calling process. Every workbook question is answered by the ArcRho Server host, because linked workbooks live on network shares and the server is the machine that must be able to open them for anything to work: a Client PC's own view of a path says nothing about that, and reading workbooks over SMB from clients is what the transport avoids.
- `/excel_links/list` is the registered `excel_link_listing` [workspace read](workspace_reads.md) (`excel_link_service.list_reserving_class_excel_links`), hosted whole. It scans the reserving class's dataset sidecars (`external_links`) and v2 DFM method JSONs (Ratios User Entry `inputs`) with bounded parallel reads, groups references by workbook path (case/separator-insensitive), reports per-workbook usage counts, and stamps `exists`/`mtime` from the host's own stat of each workbook path — so `Found` means ArcRho Server can open the workbook and `Missing` means it cannot, whatever the client sees. Unreadable JSON files are returned in `errors` instead of being silently dropped. The same function runs locally only when no gateway offers the read (or the process is itself a server process). Each workbook's `usages` entry names one dependent object — `kind` (`dataset`/`dfm`), `name`, `link_count`, `cell_count`, and `method_type`, plus for a dataset its `dataset_type` (the DFM entry carries `""` there, because a method is addressed by its own name). `method_type` comes from `dataset_sidecar_status_service.normalize_method_type` for a dataset — the same owner the reserving-class index reads, so the manager's Method Type column and the dataset table's cannot drift — and is `DFM` for a method usage. The manager renders one table row per usage and opens the named object from it, so the Dataset Type Name must come from the sidecar that owns it rather than being guessed client-side from the instance name.
- `/excel_links/retarget` is the `excel_link_retarget` hosted-save kind (`SAVE_JOB_KINDS` → `excel_link_service.retarget_reserving_class_workbook`), executed on ArcRho Engine under the reserving-class lease like every save, over the Gateway when it advertises the kind and otherwise as a request file; `/excel_links/retarget/plan` is the dormant plan sibling every hosted-save kind carries. On the Engine the retarget first opens the picked workbook with `excel_service.excel_workbook_readable` and refuses with `400` (`ArcRho Server cannot open the selected workbook: <reason>`) when the server cannot read it — nothing is written; the window shows that verdict together with the path the user picked, since the server redacts paths from its messages. Otherwise it preflights the class hold, reads every mapped cell of every affected dataset and DFM (including other-workbook references inside affected DFM formulas) in one deduplicated openpyxl batch, and rewrites and refreshes each affected file through its canonical save — `save_dataset_sidecar` for datasets (always, even when every refreshed value equals the stored snapshot: the link changed, which is an audited change; when the CSV cannot be loaded the sidecar alone is saved and the cells are reported as failed) and `save_dfm_method` for DFMs, after which the DFM's output sidecar is marked Review Needed (`dfm_service._mark_review_needed`) because an explicit save resets it and its inputs moved without the owner looking. The nested saves run under `suspended_reserving_class_hold_check()` and `deferred_save_propagation()`, so their roots — every affected dataset plus every affected DFM's output, the latter added explicitly because a DFM save with an unchanged publication submits none — are collected and the class is walked once at the end (inline on the Engine, one queued job from a direct caller); the walk re-marks the whole reachable closure Review Needed and refreshes it, so every dependent is flagged whether or not the new workbook changed a value. Value rules mirror the client Links-tab refresh: dataset links accept any finite number, store blank cells as null, and stay per-link atomic on failures; DFM cells require a finite result greater than zero rounded to six decimals, standalone ranges spill literal values into non-anchor User Entry cells, and a formula mixing Excel and dataset references reports a per-cell error to be refreshed from the DFM Links tab. Cells that cannot be refreshed keep their stored values while the reference rewrite still persists. The response carries per-file `results`, the aggregate counts, the flush's `propagation` payload, and the refreshed inventory (resolved on the same host) so the client pays one round trip.
- `save_propagation_roots(project, reserving, old_workbook_path, new_workbook_path)` mirrors the roots the retarget collects (affected datasets by `dataset_type`, affected DFM output datasets through `dfm_service.save_propagation_roots`), which is what lets the kind live in the hosted-save registry.

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Retargeting is never metadata-only: every affected dataset and DFM is re-saved from the new workbook, so their audit logs, `updated_at`, publications, output CSVs, and output sidecars follow the normal save rules, and every reachable method-backed dependent ends at Review Needed. Plain input datasets cannot carry Review Needed themselves (their `method_type` is `None`); their dependents are what the walk flags.
- Legacy v1 DFM method files are ignored by both listing and retarget; they surface only after their one-time v2 upgrade.
- After the walk the reserving-class `index.json` is rebuilt once more, covering the review flags stamped after the DFM saves and a queued (non-inline) walk; open Dataset windows learn about the on-disk change through the existing object-change fingerprint watch.
- The new workbook must be readable by ArcRho Server at retarget time; picking the already-linked workbook is a no-op success.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Add link source kinds (other method types): extend the scan/rewrite pair and `save_propagation_roots` in `excel_link_service.py` and keep the reference syntax mirrored with `ui/shared/integrations/excel_reference.js`.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- The Python reference parser must stay in sync with the canonical frontend Excel-reference syntax.
- Retargeting changes saved files that open Dataset/DFM windows may hold in memory; their change-watch alert and DFM owned-revision conflicts are the guardrails.
- The Engine's service profile must be able to reach every share that holds linked workbooks; a share only client PCs map reports `Missing` and refuses retargets, by design.
