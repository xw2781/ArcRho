# App Server Domain: stochastic_consolidation

## Purpose
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
Load, run, and save a Stochastic Consolidation, which combines the simulated reserves of several Bootstrap methods ("segments") into one total distribution. The segments live in other reserving classes and are named by class path and method name; the consolidation never reads its host class's datasets. Every number comes from `python-api/src/arcrho_api/stochastic_consolidation_contract.py`; the service only reads, checks, and publishes.

## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Used by the Stochastic Consolidation method page.
- **Load** (`stochastic_consolidation_load`, hosted read) returns the method JSON and its output sidecar, validated as a pair, plus one `segments` row per included bootstrap: class, method, factor, `status` (`current`, `changed`, `missing`, or `not_consolidated`), the bootstrap's simulation count, seed, base triangle type (its DFM's input triangle), standalone scaled mean, standard deviation and CV, and `problems` (`missing`, `no_run`, `simulation_count_mismatch`, `base_type_mismatch`) for the row to show inline. `stale_segments` lists the non-current rows and `run_state` is `up_to_date`, `not_run`, `inputs_changed` (the run's own settings moved since `results_tab.input_revision`), or `segment_changed`.
- **Consolidate** (`stochastic_consolidation_consolidate`, hosted read) runs the page's current settings: it re-simulates every segment from its bootstrap's seed and combines them. It writes nothing; the route drops `results_tab` from the request because a run rebuilds it. A missing segment is refused with 404 and a mismatched base type or simulation count with 422, each naming `class / method`.
- **Segment picker** (`stochastic_consolidation_candidates`, hosted read) lists every Bootstrap in the project's other reserving classes with the same figures as a segment row.
- **Save** and **save/plan** are the `stochastic_consolidation_method` hosted save. Save is revision-aware like every method (a stale owned revision is 409; derived state rebases). It consolidates again whenever there is no stored run, the run's settings changed, or any segment is not current, so a saved consolidation always publishes the run of its saved inputs; a notes-only save keeps the stored run (`consolidated: false`). The method JSON and CSVs are written first and the sidecar last, with rollback on failure.

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- The method file is `methods/SCON@<Name>.json` (`arcrho-stochastic-consolidation-v4`); the output vector is the consolidated mean ultimate by origin, with aggregated 3/6/12 variants.
- Simulations are never persisted, for the consolidation or its segments: each run rebuilds them from the seeds, and the method keeps a summary rich enough for every Results view.
- Each segment records the revision of the bootstrap it consumed (`bootstrap_revision`), which is how the load tells a changed segment.
- The output sidecar lists each segment as a precedent carrying its `reserving_class`. No reverse `dependents` edge is written onto a bootstrap's sidecar.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Change the payload only in `arcrho_api/stochastic_consolidation_contract.py` and its parity tests.
2. Keep every segment read addressed by the segment's own reserving class.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- **Cross-class propagation is deferred.** Saving a bootstrap does not refresh the consolidations that include it; freshness is checked on open instead, and the page offers Consolidate. Deleting or renaming a bootstrap is not blocked by a consolidation that includes it; the load then reports that segment `missing`.
- A 10,000-simulation run re-simulates every segment (roughly 1.4 seconds each) inside the host class's lock on Save.
