## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Node scripts from `package.json` drive build orchestration.
- `launch_arcrho_dev_mode.bat` is the single development launcher for both products: no argument launches ArcRho, an `arcode` argument launches Arcode. It runs `electron_shell.py` under `pythonw` with `ARCRHO_BACKEND_CONSOLE=hidden`, so neither the supervisor nor the backend opens a console window, and it leaves the display version to `app.getVersion()`. Only the supervisor uses `pythonw`: `PYTHON_EXE` stays the console build because Electron passes it to the app server, and uvicorn logs to stderr, which is `None` under a GUI-subsystem interpreter with no console. The backend stays windowless through Electron's `windowsHide` and ignored stdio instead. For the same reason the supervisor redirects its own child to the null device whenever its streams are absent. It replaces `start_electron.bat`, `start_electron_no_python_window.bat`, and `start_arcode.bat`.
- PyInstaller spec (`build/server.spec`) builds backend executable artifacts and includes the served `ui/` and `icons/` asset trees. Both ArcRho and Arcode specs prepend the monorepo `python-api/src` path before collecting `arcrho_api`, so a separately installed older wheel cannot replace the canonical source bundled for that build.
- After each ArcRho or Arcode PyInstaller collection completes, `build/write_backend_artifact_manifest.py` hashes every collected backend file except its own output and atomically writes `backend-artifact.json`. Electron passes that immutable full-bundle identity to the server and uses it to reject a stale same-version listener.
- `build/release/release_notes.py` validates unreleased change fragments and generates versioned release notes in `docs/releases/`.
- There are two supported release entry points, and both run the same build body in `build/build_app_via_local_workspace.bat`. `build/build_app_from_local_repo.bat` builds in place from the repository on the current PC; the two-PC ZIP workflow drives the same wrapper across a build share. Neither `build_app.bat` nor `build_app_from_network.bat` exists any more.
- Both entry points update the app version before packaging: by default the patch version is bumped from the GitHub Releases history, and an explicit semantic version argument overrides that default.
- The wrapper mirrors console output into a timestamped `build_<product>_via_local_workspace_<timestamp>.log`. The two-PC workflow writes it to `E:\XWSpace\Build ArcRho App\logs\<COMPUTERNAME>`; a local build sets `ARCRHO_BUILD_LOG_DIR` and writes beside its own work directory instead.
- `build/create_build_source_zip.bat` creates and validates the curated `ArcRho.zip` consumed by the local-workspace build wrapper, preserving portable Node dependencies while excluding repository metadata and generated artifacts; it logs each run to `E:\XWSpace\Build ArcRho App\logs\<COMPUTERNAME>\create_build_source_zip_<timestamp>.log`.
- `build/build_app_from_local_repo.bat` is the single-PC entry point: it validates prerequisites, sets `ARCRHO_BUILD_IN_PLACE`, and runs the wrapper against the repository's own `frontend`. Because the build is not in a disposable workspace, the version bump, release notes, and archived fragments land directly in the working tree, so it finishes with `sync_published_release.py --bookkeeping-only` rather than a listener round trip.
- Windows packaging currently sets `win.signAndEditExecutable` to `false` so local unsigned test installers skip Electron Builder's executable signing/resource-edit helper on locked-down PCs.
- ArcRho and Arcode packaging use electron-builder's built-in `APP_BUILD_DIR` / `File /r` installation path, preserving NSIS's native green progress behavior. For ArcRho, the patcher compiles a hidden x86 .NET Framework observer before packaging; the InstFiles page launches it before the installation worker starts, and it reads the native progress control to update the visible percentage and elapsed-rate estimate without running callbacks inside the NSIS interpreter. The time-left value refreshes every five seconds and is capped at five minutes while the percentage can continue advancing between estimate refreshes.
- The assisted ArcRho installer keeps action-level output in a details panel that is collapsed by default. The same native NSIS details button is used in both states: **Show details** expands the panel, then the observer moves that control below the panel and relabels it **Hide details**; its native click signal restores the collapsed layout. The InstFiles header omits the redundant **Installing** title while retaining its explanatory subtitle, and the status caption above the green bar remains reserved for percentage and estimated time remaining.
- The custom NSIS include loads `MUI2.nsh` before using Modern UI header macros because electron-builder prepends the custom include ahead of its base installer template. That position also puts it ahead of `multiUser.nsh` and of electron-builder's `!addplugindir` lines, so its install-mode variables (`$perUserInstallationFolder`, `$perMachineInstallationFolder`) and StdUtils plugin calls are only usable from the `customInit` macro, which is expanded inside `.onInit`. Using either in a function body fails the build - makensis runs with `-WX`, so the unknown-variable warning becomes an error, and the plugin cannot be resolved that early.
- The patcher also raises electron-builder's `spawnAndWrite` kill timeout in `builder-util` from 4 to 30 minutes. That budget assumes makensis only embeds a pre-built `app.7z`; ArcRho compresses the whole unpacked app inside makensis, which takes longer. The kill arrives as a signal, so a build that hits it reports `Exit code: null` with empty compiler output and no diagnostics.
- On fresh ArcRho installs running on `NE7SASWPN02`, setup detects the Windows login name and prepares `E:\<login>\ArcRho` as the directory-page default. Existing install locations and explicit `/D` paths retain precedence. If setup cannot create and verify the E-drive directory, it leaves electron-builder's standard per-user location unchanged (normally on C:). The build patcher supplies an invisible pre-directory hook so the visible directory field receives this default after the install-mode page; silent installs apply the same rule during initialization.
- The ArcRho assisted installer's Setup Options page also offers a "Launch ArcRho data engine at login" checkbox next to the Excel add-in option. It is enabled and checked by default only when the detected `ArcRho Server` folder sits on a local fixed drive (`GetDriveType` = `DRIVE_FIXED`), i.e. the install runs on the computer that hosts the server folder; on a mapped network drive the checkbox is disabled with an explanatory note. When selected, the installer runs `<server root>\apps\ArcRho Launcher\ArcRho Launcher.exe` (legacy fallback `ADAS Shell`); the launcher itself registers its shortcut in the user's `shell:startup` folder and starts the orchestrator and bridge, so the installer does not duplicate that logic.
- ArcRho Desktop Setup never embeds, installs, upgrades, repairs, or uninstalls the shared server binaries. Before legacy drive-name scanning it reads `%APPDATA%\ArcRho\workspace_paths.json`; for a configured local workspace it enables the launch option only when an existing Launcher is present. A missing deployment directs the operator to `ArcRho-Server-Setup-<version>.exe`, whose lifecycle is documented in `server-components/docs/server-components-deployment.md`.
- The ArcRho assisted installer shows an Excel add-in option at the start of setup, checked by default. It first scans available drive roots for an existing `ArcRho Server` folder and uses that folder when found; otherwise, it asks the user to choose the root drive from a dropdown and derives `<drive>\ArcRho Server\Excel Add-ins\ArcRho.xlam` from that selection. When selected, the installer opens `User Guide.xlsm` in an isolated hidden Excel instance, runs its `InstallNetworkXLAM` macro with the derived add-in path, and verifies that Excel reports the add-in as installed. Excel's configured Trust Center policy remains in force; the installer does not lower macro security. When Excel refuses to run that macro, the failure dialog stays task-focused: it gives the manual `File > Options > Add-ins` path to `ArcRho.xlam` and the Trusted Locations change that lets setup register it next time (allow trusted locations on the network, then trust `<server root>\Excel Add-ins` with subfolders). The raw PowerShell error text is not repeated in the dialog; it remains in the installer details panel.
- Successful build flows now clean `python_dist/` and `python_build/` automatically.
- The desktop startup update check reads GitHub Releases on `xw2781/ArcRho` (override with `ARCRHO_UPDATE_GITHUB_REPO`/`ARCODE_UPDATE_GITHUB_REPO`), matching a release asset named `ArcRho-Setup-<version>.exe`/`Arcode-Setup-<version>.exe` with a sibling `<installer>.sha256` checksum asset; release notes and an optional `mandatory: true` marker line come from the release body. The check scans the 30 most recent releases and shows the notes for every version between the installed build and the one it will install, so skipping a version does not skip its notes; only the winning version's checksum asset is fetched. The generated `docs/releases/*.md` notes are packaged with the app (`files: ["**/*"]`) and back the offline About > Release History window, so an installer must keep shipping that folder.
- `build/release/publish_github_release.ps1 -InstallerPath dist\ArcRho-Setup-<version>.exe -ProductName ArcRho` publishes (or updates) the GitHub Release tagged `ArcRho-v<version>` with the installer and its `.sha256` checksum as assets, using the `gh` CLI (`gh auth login` or `GH_TOKEN` must be configured on the build machine first).
- Published Windows installers are also staged in `E:\ArcRho Server\releases\installers` as a manual/backup copy; the desktop app no longer reads this feed for update checks. The preferred feed shape is `latest.json`, `ArcRho-Setup-<version>.exe`, and `ArcRho-Setup-<version>.exe.sha256`; `latest.json` should include `version`, `installer`, and `sha256`, with optional `releaseNotes`, `mandatory`, and `publishedAt`.
- The build no longer writes that backup feed. Publish to it by hand with `build/release/publish_update_feed.ps1` when a migration build needs it.
- `build/release/publish_update_feed.ps1 -InstallerPath dist\ArcRho-Setup-<version>.exe` publishes that backup feed shape to `E:\ArcRho Server\releases\installers` by default.
- `npm run build:arcode` builds the standalone Arcode product from the ArcRho-owned Arcode source, using `build/arcode_server.spec`, `electron-builder.arcode.json`, and the `python_dist/arcode_server` extra resource.
- Standalone Arcode packaging uses product name `Arcode`, appId `com.arcode.app`, artifact `Arcode-Setup-<version>.exe`, and a slim scripting-only app server.
- The Arcode Python server bundle includes `snowflake-connector-python` for the Snowflake SQL console; `build/check_python_build_env.py` fails fast when the selected Python 3.10 environment is missing it.
- `build/check_python_build_env.py` also requires `pyodbc`, which `build/server.spec` bundles for the managed source-table import. Both the module and the ODBC driver stay optional at runtime, so a build machine without `pyodbc` would otherwise ship a server whose SQL Server import always answers `503`.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Build outputs: `dist/`, `python_build/`, `python_dist/`.
- The packaged server bundle is expected to contain `python_dist/arcrho_server/_internal/ui/index.html` and `python_dist/arcrho_server/_internal/icons/icon.png`; `build/build_python_server.bat` fails fast when either served asset tree is missing.
- Packaged ArcRho and Arcode server bundles contain a sibling `backend-artifact.json` manifest covering the executable, Python runtime, and served assets. The manifest is generated only after required bundle files are validated.
- The packaged Arcode server bundle is expected to contain `python_dist/arcode_server/_internal/ui/arcode/main.html`, `python_dist/arcode_server/_internal/ui/ai-assistant/index.js`, `python_dist/arcode_server/_internal/ui/libs/monaco-editor/min/vs/loader.js`, and the Snowflake connector runtime modules; `build/build_arcode_python_server.bat` fails fast when required served assets are missing.
- Two-PC build logs: `E:\XWSpace\Build ArcRho App\logs\<COMPUTERNAME>\create_build_source_zip_<timestamp>.log` and `build_<product>_via_local_workspace_<timestamp>.log`. A local build redirects the same wrapper log to `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\ArcRho Local Build\logs\<COMPUTERNAME>` through `ARCRHO_BUILD_LOG_DIR`.
- Installer settings in `package.json`, `build/installer/installer.nsh`, `build/installer/installer_progress_helper.cs`, `build/installer/install_arcrho_excel_addin.ps1`, and `build/installer/patch_nsis_installer_progress.js`.
- `build/installer/detect_arcrho_server_root.ps1` is the frontend installer's read-only adapter for the canonical per-user workspace configuration. Server-component build output and receipts are owned by the separate data-engine installer.
- Release tracking data lives under `changes/unreleased/`, `changes/archive/`, and `docs/releases/`.
- `python_dist/` and `python_build/` are transient and removed after successful packaging.
- Runtime update feed files are external deployment artifacts under `E:\ArcRho Server\releases\installers`; only `build/release/publish_update_feed.ps1` writes them, and only when run by hand.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Update app packaging metadata: edit `package.json` `build` block.
2. Update bundled backend: edit `build/server.spec` for ArcRho or `build/arcode_server.spec` for Arcode and verify `extraResources` mappings.
3. Add or update unreleased change fragments in `changes/unreleased/` before packaging a release.
4. To release from the PC that holds the repository, follow the [local release build](../../build/docs/BUILD_FROM_LOCAL_REPO.md) and run `build\build_app_from_local_repo.bat`. Add a version argument (for example `build\build_app_from_local_repo.bat 2.0.0`) when you need a specific release version; otherwise the patch version is auto-incremented.
5. When the PC holding the repository cannot run the full toolchain, follow the [two-PC ZIP build workflow](../../build/docs/BUILD_FROM_ZIP_ON_SECOND_PC.md) instead, so packaging executes from a local filesystem on the build PC.
6. If a packaged build fails, inspect the newest `build_<product>_via_local_workspace_<timestamp>.log` in the log directory the entry point reported.
7. If inspecting PyInstaller artifacts is needed, run `npm run build:python` or `npm run build:arcode:python` directly (the full build cleans them on success).
8. If electron-builder is reinstalled or upgraded, rerun `npm run build:electron` or either release entry point; all paths reapply the ArcRho NSIS installer-progress patch before packaging.
9. After validating a release installer outside the normal build flow, publish it to GitHub Releases (the source the desktop app actually checks) with `build\release\publish_github_release.ps1 -InstallerPath dist\ArcRho-Setup-<version>.exe -ReleaseNotes "<summary>"`, and optionally also to the backup network feed with `build\release\publish_update_feed.ps1 -InstallerPath dist\ArcRho-Setup-<version>.exe -ReleaseNotes "<summary>"`.
10. Build and publish the matching server-host companion separately with `py -3.10 server-components/server-installer/build_release.py` and `server-components/server-installer/publish_server_installer.ps1`; do not add its payload to Electron `extraResources` or `installer.nsh`.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Packaging excludes can accidentally omit runtime files.
- A frontend/server version mismatch can leave request-contract producers and workers out of sync. The server release builder rejects a version different from `frontend/package.json`, and publication requires the matching `ArcRho-v<version>` release.
- Divergence between dev and packaged paths causes startup failures.
- With `asar: true`, `APP_ROOT` resolves inside `resources\app.asar`, a virtual path only Electron's patched `fs` can see. Windows cannot use it as a child-process working directory, and such a spawn fails as `spawn <command> ENOENT`, which misleadingly reads as a missing executable. `electron/main.js` therefore launches host commands from `getHostSpawnCwd()`, which skips `.asar` candidates and falls back to the app's user-data directory, and resolves `powershell.exe` under `%SystemRoot%` instead of relying on the inherited `PATH`.
- Disabling `win.signAndEditExecutable` is intended for local unsigned launch testing; restore the normal resource-edit/signing path before preparing a polished release installer.
- electron-builder NSIS implementation changes can break the ArcRho installer-progress patch; `build/installer/patch_nsis_installer_progress.js` fails fast when the upstream compressor, details, or extraction templates no longer match a supported form.
- ArcRho installer packaging requires the Windows .NET Framework 4 C# compiler to build the isolated progress observer. The helper has no network or filesystem behavior at runtime, but managed endpoint security should still be smoke-tested against the generated executable launched from NSIS's plugin directory.
