## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Hosts configure the widget through `ui/ai-assistant/arcrho.js` or `ui/ai-assistant/arcode.js`.
- Uses the Electron preload `codexAssistant*` APIs, including `codexAssistantModels` for runtime catalog discovery.
- Discovers picker-visible OpenAI models from the bundled Codex app server's `model/list` response. The runtime catalog owns each model's display name and supported reasoning efforts. The runtime contract (`electron/arcbot_runtime_contract.json`) names the preferred default (`defaultModel`, GPT-6.1-Sol) and the default effort (`defaultReasoningEffort`, Medium); the preferred model is the default while Codex advertises it, a newer GPT version that Codex itself defaults to takes over automatically, and otherwise ArcBot promotes an advertised model at or above the `minimumDefaultModel` floor.
- Discovers Claude models from the Anthropic Models API (`GET /v1/models` on `api.anthropic.com`, the same host and the same signed-in Claude Code token the chat requests already use) and offers the newest Fable, Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, with each model's effort levels read from its reported capabilities. Without credentials or when that call fails, the built-in list in `electron/arcbot_model_catalog.js` is used: Claude Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, and Haiku 4.5. Sonnet is the Claude default. Claude requests send the chosen level as `output_config.effort` (thinking is adaptive on these models); Haiku takes no effort.
- The host keeps both discovered lists for six hours, then re-reads them on the next request; opening the settings popover asks for the list, and Refresh status forces a re-read. A failed timed re-read keeps the last verified list.
- Keeps an explicit saved model selection when that model remains available, including legacy GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.4 selections. New chats and legacy `codex` default selections resolve to the verified discovered default at the default effort, and switching between OpenAI and Claude resets the effort to that provider model's default (Medium). "Codex default" appears in the picker only while discovery has no list or when an older chat still uses it. If an older CLI does not advertise any GPT-5.6 model, ArcBot requires Repair instead of fabricating or saving an unavailable choice; if discovery itself is temporarily unavailable, ArcBot blocks sends and offers retry/Repair rather than delegating to an unverified CLI default.
- The composer's context ring tooltip lists the chat's model, reasoning effort (when the model takes one), and context-window usage. The dictate and attach buttons use the same tooltip bubble (`ui/ai-assistant/composer-tip.js`) instead of the OS title tip.
- The Model and Reasoning pickers are app-styled listboxes (`ui/ai-assistant/select-menu.js`) over the hidden native selects: provider group headers, a quiet "Default" tag, a check on the current item, arrow/Home/End/Enter keyboard control, and close on Escape or an outside click.
- Runs bundled Codex child processes from the current user's writable `Documents\ArcRho` folder rather than the packaged ASAR path. The Repair action installs the CLI into an ArcRho-owned per-user npm prefix, so it does not require writing to protected application or machine-global folders.
- Repair checks npm's exit code, requires `codex.cmd` in that exact per-user prefix, and verifies `--version` before reporting completion or saving a command hint. A failed install (including disk-full `ENOSPC`) is not masked by a missing-launcher message or a different Codex already on PATH.
- Exchanges assistant context/update messages with active iframes using host-specific namespaces.
- ArcBot reads project data only through the server: the host starts every run in the local exchange folder, gives the model file names rather than server paths, and exposes the read-only `arcrho_project_read` tool for methods and datasets in the open project or, when the user asks, any other project on the server. The host runs the Python API's Gateway client outside the network-disabled CLI sandbox (see the ArcBot host notes in [shell.md](shell.md)). With no extra folders added, Folder Permissions says "Project data is read through the server."
- ArcBot never writes a page's file. An edit comes back from the host as `editProposed` with the edited JSON. The widget rechecks that the originating tab and method are still open and active before posting `<namespace>:assistant-apply-json-edit`. That page applies it as one undoable change and saves it through its own save: a DFM through its normal hosted save, an Arcode notebook or JSON editor as unsaved changes the user saves. "Revert the latest ArcBot edit" posts `<namespace>:assistant-revert-json-edit` through the same active-page check and only undoes the page's latest ArcBot change. Ask for Approval keeps its DFM compare review and lands through the same apply.
- Right-clicking the ArcBot launcher opens a compact launcher menu with a Hide action; the View menu remains the restore path when the launcher is hidden.
- The settings popover opens with an Account section: one "Default" picker showing the single account every chat runs under (new and existing), with its provider, email, plan, "Not signed in", or "Signing in…". Its menu (`ui/ai-assistant/accounts.js`) lists the OpenAI and Anthropic accounts in two groups with a check on the one selected, per-row Sign in/Sign out and Remove (a second click confirms) actions, and an Add Account… per group, which takes a name inline and opens the vendor sign-in window. The selected account's provider decides the models: the model list shows only that provider's models, and a chat whose model belongs to the other provider (on selecting an account, on loading a chat, or on creating one) switches to that provider's default model. The Context panel shows the active account as an "Account" row, and the Online/Offline badge's tooltip lists the connection state, the latest status message, and the active account on separate lines. Account errors appear in a quiet line under the picker.
- `electron/arcbot_accounts.js` owns the account list. Each provider has a built-in Primary account that uses the CLI's own folder (`~/.codex`, `~/.claude`) and runs with `CODEX_HOME` / `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` removed; an added account is an isolated folder under the preferences folder's `arcbot_accounts/`, and the variable points at it. A new account copies only `config.toml`/`AGENTS.md` (Codex) or `settings.json`/`CLAUDE.md` (Claude) from Primary; credentials are never copied. The list, the last account chosen per provider, and which provider is current (the selected account) are stored in `arcbot_accounts.json` beside `arcbot_ui_settings.json`. Removing an account deletes its folder only when it sits under `arcbot_accounts/`; Primary cannot be removed.
- Every Codex run (status, app server, exec, sign-in, sign-out) gets the active Codex account's environment, and Claude requests read the access token from the active Claude account's `.credentials.json`. Switching restarts the Codex app server or clears the Claude model list, so it is refused while a reply is running ("Wait for the current reply to finish."). Listing accounts on a machine without the Claude CLI starts a background install of a per-user copy, and a Claude sign-in waits on it or starts it; the copy is (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code` under `claude-cli` beside `codex-cli` in the app data folder) with the bundled npm, then opens the sign-in window.
- Sign-in runs `codex login` or `claude auth login` in a terminal window under the account's environment; sign-out runs `codex logout` or `claude auth logout`. The host marks a launched sign-in pending until the account's credential file changes or five minutes pass; the widget polls the list every three seconds while anything is pending and re-checks status when the active account finishes. Identity comes from the account's own files: the Codex `auth.json` ID-token email and ChatGPT plan ("API key" for key-only sign-ins), and the Claude `.claude.json` email (`~/.claude.json` for Primary) with the `.credentials.json` subscription type. Token values are never sent to the renderer.
- Changing the account or the model in a chat that already has messages adds a quiet line at the end of the chat ("Account changed to Work.", "Switched to <model>.", or "Continuing this chat on <model> with <account>." when an account of the other provider changes the model). The first two add "The first reply may be slower." only while the last assistant reply is under an hour old, since that is how long a saved prompt cache lasts; the line is not saved and disappears when the conversation continues. Reasoning-effort changes show no line.
- The settings popover's Current Chat login row shows the selected account: its name with its provider and email, plan, "not signed in", or "signing in".
- ArcBot chat responses render SQL-looking inline code snippets and fenced `sql`, `mssql`, and `tsql` code blocks with the same lightweight SQL token colors used by the SQL review diff.
- Shows a slash-triggered Skills menu in the composer. The SQL Format Validation skill reads active Arcode SQL editor context or selected SQL lines, resolves T-SQL versus Snowflake explicitly, requests the same parser-backed formatting preview used by the editor toolbar, and opens the deterministic diff immediately while optional AI review continues in ArcBot. Formatting is applicable only after parse/token/protected-text/idempotence safety checks pass; unsafe or stale previews leave the editor unchanged. Optional Codex review uses a strict structured-output schema, groups material findings into syntax/formatting and performance/optimization sections, and omits duplicate SQL from App Context. A host-namespaced `assistant-replace-text` message is sent only after the user accepts the draggable and resizable syntax-highlighted diff. Activating the ArcBot chat panel raises it above the SQL review window.
- Warm Codex turns stream assistant text into the active chat bubble as deltas arrive, then replace that plain streaming view with the normal rich-text rendering when the final response completes. SQL structured-review turns suppress raw JSON delta rendering.
- ArcRho supplies host-specific App Context tooltip rows for project-instance DFM windows, including project, path, method name, and DFM tab when available.

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Opening or creating a chat prepares one empty, read-only Codex thread per renderer before Send. Sends consume that thread with fresh page context and the actual turn sandbox; completion prepares the next one. Model/chat changes replace unused preparations; window destruction and host shutdown release them. Failed preparation is visible and can retry on Send. Claude remains on demand.
- The work log shows literal commands, streamed output, exit status and intermediate commentary. Completion collapses the procedures and leaves the final answer visible. The host keeps the last agent message as the reply even when turn completion omits items; intermediate text must not be concatenated into the summary.
- Dictate uses the installed Windows System.Speech recognizer and default microphone locally, without uploading audio or downloading a model. Phrases append to the editable composer; Send remains explicit. Stop, closing the panel, changing chat, sending, window destruction, or the two-minute limit releases the microphone. Missing devices/languages and recognition errors appear beside the composer. Accuracy and available languages depend on the installed Windows recognizer.
- The composer exposes Dictate as a microphone SVG icon with a shared tooltip and accessible start/stop labels. Its red pressed state indicates active dictation; clicking again stops it without changing the control's size.
- Composer controls always occupy one row. The chat's minimum width is owned by CSS and read by the resize/restore logic, so a saved narrow size or a resize cannot wrap the controls or move Send onto another line.
- `arcrho_project_read` exposes registered method loads, dataset loads, `project_names` and class/index discovery over the Gateway. Its catalog derives method families and arguments from `WORKSPACE_READ_KINDS`; `project_name` defaults to the open project (and the open class default applies only to it), any other project is readable when named, and the host exposes no mutation/save or simulation. The CLI keeps network access disabled. The model can review methods whose UI windows are closed when requested; project-read failures remain visible.
- Applying or reverting an edit rechecks that the originating tab and target method are still open and active. A switch or closed method refuses the proposal. New Chat and history navigation cannot replace the session while a request is running.
- Run the isolated, prefilled GUI fixture with `node_modules/electron/dist/electron.exe tests/arcbot_gui_harness.cjs` from `frontend`. It uses the real widget and host with a simulated CLI and project, writes only under repository `test/arcbot-gui`, and does not verify live model inference or server connectivity. Close it and remove that scratch folder after testing.
- Uses host-specific storage prefixes so ArcRho keeps `arcrho_ai_assistant_*` keys and Arcode keeps `arcode_ai_assistant_*` keys.
- Persists chat/session data through the existing Electron assistant host APIs.
- Keeps the discovered OpenAI model catalog in memory and refreshes it after a CLI repair. If discovery fails, ArcBot marks the catalog unverified and can refresh from `model/list` on a later status check; a successfully discovered stale catalog triggers Repair rather than exposing or persisting a model the CLI did not advertise.
- Persists launcher visibility per host prefix in the local ArcBot UI settings JSON, with localStorage kept as a browser fallback.
- Creates the assistant DOM once per host page at runtime.
- Keeps SQL skill diff/review state in memory only; applying the proposed SQL relies on the active editor's normal dirty/save behavior.
- SQL formatting itself is owned by the app-server SQL formatting domain; the shared widget contains only its API client, dialect/context mapping, structured AI-review contract, and preview/apply orchestration.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Change shared assistant UI or behavior: update `ui/ai-assistant/index.js`, `template.js`, `assistant.css`, and this doc together.
2. Change host-specific message/storage behavior: update the matching adapter and all producers/consumers for that namespace.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- The widget is shared by two app shells, so hardcoded app names, storage keys, or message namespaces can regress one host.
- ArcRho DFM edit approval must stay disabled in Arcode and enabled only through the ArcRho adapter.
- ArcRho-only project instance labels should remain in the ArcRho adapter rather than the shared widget fallback.
- The tracked ArcBot runtime contract owns the minimum bundled CLI version and default model. Packaging must verify both against the installer runtime, while an account-visible newer detected default takes precedence.
