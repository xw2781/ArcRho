## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Opens from Project Instance as a floating iframe method window at `/ui/method_pages/bornhuetter_ferguson/bornhuetter_ferguson.html`. Home no longer offers a Bornhuetter Ferguson launch card, but the shell keeps `openBornhuetterFergusonTab` for the standalone restorable tab used by tab restore and UI automation.
- Uses `ui/shared/tabbed_page/` for reusable tab chrome and pop-out behavior, and `ui/shared/tabs/details/`, `ui/shared/tabs/notes/`, and `ui/shared/tabs/audit_log/` for shared tab presentation. BF modules still own method persistence, calculations, dirty state, save/close coordination, and BF-specific behavior; the established BF tab IDs and `arcrho:*` contracts remain unchanged. BF also uses shared dataset origin-label, dataset picker, filename-sanitizer, and save-bar helpers, and its tab labels use the same Arial-first application font stack as Dataset tabs.
- Details, Method table, Audit Log table, select carets, and save actions follow the compact DFM-style ArcRho controls; single-value BF dataset pickers use the same three-dot button design as DFM Details.
- Every BF tab uses the shared white `bfPageHost` workspace surface inside the DFM-style gutter and border frame.
- Closing a dirty BF window from its titlebar, Cancel button, or close shortcut opens the shared page-local confirmation used by Dataset, DFM, and Result Selection. Yes sends the confirmed discard to Project Instance and closes the window in the same action; Cancel, Escape, clicking the backdrop, or closing the box returns to the dirty BF page, which remains inert while the modal is open.
- Origin Length uses a narrow 70px custom dropdown with the numeric period options `12`, `6`, `3`, and `1`; its menu layers above the adjacent source panel.
- The Details tab stacks the object fields above the source fields in two full-width panels without separate panel-header bars. Its contents use the shared Details-page typography: Arial-first, 12px black labels and controls, literal `Label : ` punctuation, and a 1px label-to-control gap.
- The source fields are labeled `Latest`, `Development Pattern`, and `Prior Vector`; their persisted method fields remain `latest_dataset`, `dfm_dataset`, and `prior_datasets`.
- Selected Prior Vector entries use a full-width 30px stacked row with the standard outer frame and pale-blue hover/focus treatment. The Prior Vector picker height grows in 30px increments, with a separate `+ Add datasets` row after the entries. The inline SVG close control appears when its row is hovered or receives keyboard focus; clicking an entry opens its dataset through the Project Instance related-dataset route, while clicking the close control removes it. Dropping a dragged entry outside the Prior Vector box or choosing Delete from its right-click context menu also removes it.
- Loads a saved BF through `/bornhuetter-ferguson/load`, which reads only `methods/BF@<Name>.json` and the output sidecar in parallel. The saved method snapshot hydrates Details, Method, and Chart; the same aggregate response hydrates Notes and Audit without generic sidecar graph enrichment.
- Saves through `/bornhuetter-ferguson/save`, which publishes `methods/BF@<Name>.json`, the native `datasets/<Name>@<OriginLength>.csv`, any supported coarser CSV variants, and the output sidecar as one server-owned transaction with the sidecar written last.
- The output sidecar keeps `source_kind: "bornhuetter_ferguson"`, `method_type: "Bornhuetter Ferguson"`, Notes, Audit, status, and dependency graph fields. Audit renders newest first with the shared Dataset/BF/RS/DFM table and is not part of BF dirty-state tracking; the method JSON keeps only an empty structural `audit_log_tab` group.
- Uses Project Instance `arcrho:dataset-dirty`, `arcrho:dataset-save`, `arcrho:dependency-source-preview`, `arcrho:dependency-source-cleared`, `arcrho:project-instance-refresh-datasets`, `arcrho:project-instance-open-dependent-dataset`, and `arcrho:bf-tab-changed` messages.
- Open-window change alert: after a successful method load or save, the page watches its `BF@<name>.json` and output sidecar through `/object_change/fingerprint` (`ui/shared/services/object_change_watch.js`) and shows a one-time "close and reopen" message box when another user or the Engine dependent-propagation job rewrites the method; the save flow pauses and rebases the watch so its own writes never alert. The alert offers a Refresh Now action that reloads the window in place when it has no unsaved changes. Dependent-propagation jobs started by this app instance never raise the alert: Project Instance broadcasts `arcrho:dependent-propagation-started`/`-finished` scope messages that pause the watch for the job's project and reserving class and rebase it at the terminal status.

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- The canonical method type label is exactly `Bornhuetter Ferguson` in UI, method JSON, and sidecar metadata.
- V3 inputs are one latest triangle, one DFM output vector, and one or more prior ultimate vectors with non-negative row weights. V3 is the only supported self-contained format; earlier BF files must be re-imported from their canonical source.
- A current saved BF opens from its method JSON and own raw sidecar only. It does not load the reserving-class index, Dataset Types, project headers, source sidecars, source CSVs, or dependency graph details. Dataset inventory is loaded lazily only for a new method or an explicit source picker.
- Open BF windows consume matching Project Instance live dependency previews for Latest, Development Pattern, and Prior Vector sources. Dirty upstream Dataset, DFM, or method changes temporarily replace the matching in-memory source vector and immediately recompute Percentage Developed, Selected Prior, New Ultimate, and the Chart without changing the BF window's own dirty state. When a preview is cleared, saved, or discarded, BF restores the aggregate persisted BF snapshot and reapplies any other active previews instead of reopening each precedent.
- Durable ArcRho precedent saves eagerly refresh registered BF method JSON, output CSV variants, and sidecar while preserving row weights and display settings. The refreshed BF remains Review Needed until its own explicit Save; Refresh alone does not acknowledge the alert. Every Save starts downstream propagation even when the publication values are unchanged, but a valid v3 Save uses its embedded source snapshots rather than reopening precedents to validate duplicate label metadata. Readable precedents that remain Review Needed do not block Save; after the save commits, a page-local message box reports how many have not been reviewed. A failed source read, geometry check, calculation, or publication keeps the last valid method/output and reports the refresh failure separately.
- A Bornhuetter Ferguson save runs behind the shared saving animation described in [`dataset.md`](dataset.md), titled `Saving Bornhuetter Ferguson`, so the page cannot be edited while the save settles. `saveBornhuetterFerguson` wraps the save in it, so the Save bar and the shell save message are both covered; the card then streams the dependent walk's live updates and the spinner is dismissed before the post-save review warning and before the Engine-unavailable message box. Both explicit save entry points close the window after a clean walk (`propagationClean`); a failed or stalled walk keeps it open.
- The post-save review warning lists every unreviewed precedent by name. Each name is a keyboard-focusable link that opens its related method window when the dataset is method-backed, or its Dataset Viewer otherwise, while keeping the saved BF unchanged.
- Migrated BF method origin labels come from the ResQ BF method `OriginLabel(OriginIndex=...)` values and are preserved when source data is refreshed.
- BF accepts only consecutive method origin labels that match the selected Origin Length and, when source rows are refreshed, the source row count. The persisted BF method axis is canonical for refresh: CSV values are mapped to it without consulting precedent-sidecar `origin_labels`. New methods use ArcRho project headers; if no valid labels can be resolved, the Method grid leaves labels blank, reports an Origin Start Date error, and blocks saving instead of manufacturing labels from a default year.
- Latest values come from the latest diagonal of the selected actual triangle.
- Percentage Developed is derived as `Latest / DFM Ultimate`; blank values, non-numeric values, and zero DFM ultimate values produce blank percentage-developed values.
- The Method grid follows the compact ResQ BF presentation with Accident Year, Latest, Percentage Developed, one dynamic prior column and optional Weight column per selected source, Selected Prior, New Ultimate, and a selectable Total row. It is the reference consumer of `ui/shared/components/spreadsheet/spreadsheet_table.css`, which centralizes the standard grid border, header/label fills, cell dimensions, selection palette, and anchor treatment used by Dataset and other spreadsheet-style tables; BF keeps its semantic source, Weight, and result colors as local overrides. Its range normalization, selection painting, anchor/label state, movement, context-cell preparation, TSV generation, and clipboard copy use the shared `ui/shared/components/spreadsheet/spreadsheet_table.js` controller, while BF retains its weight-editing and recalculation adapter. Missing data cells display a muted gray `null` placeholder without changing the underlying empty value; structural Total-row cells remain blank. DFM Ultimate remains calculation state but is not shown separately.
- The Method toolbar contains only Result Selection-style Formatting controls for Show Weights As, Index/Effective % display, and decimal places; extra separation between the Weight display dropdown and Decimals keeps those controls visually distinct, and the Formatting group and its title use the same white background so the title cleanly masks the group border. Method cells support click-and-drag highlights, row/column selection, Shift extension, Excel-style arrow navigation, `Esc` clearing, copy, and weight paste. Plain Arrow keys collapse a multi-cell highlight to one cell moved from its dashed anchor instead of translating the entire rectangle; Shift+Arrow extends the range, and Ctrl/Cmd+Arrow moves to a grid edge. Clicking a row or column label establishes a label anchor; Shift-clicking a second label of the same type selects every row or column between those two labels. In Index mode, double-clicking a prior value or Weight cell toggles its weight between `0` and `1`; Effective % cells remain read-only. Typing or pasting into highlighted prior/Weight cells updates row weights, and Delete sets them to `0`.
- Selected Prior is the weighted average `SUM(Prior * Weight) / SUM(Weight)` across available positive-weight prior values for each row.
- New Ultimate is `Latest` when Selected Prior is blank for that row. Otherwise it is `ROUND(Latest + (1 - Percentage Developed) * Selected Prior, 0)`; it remains blank when Latest is blank, or when Percentage Developed is blank while Selected Prior is available.
- The Chart tab plots DFM Implied Ultimate (`Latest / Percentage Developed`), Selected Prior, and BF Ultimate (`New Ultimate`) as three responsive lines by origin period. Missing or zero percentage-developed inputs leave the DFM implied point blank, and hovering a plotted point shows its series, origin, and formatted value.
- Exposure and ResQ/RPC sync are deferred.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Change BF calculation behavior: update `ui/method_pages/bornhuetter_ferguson/bornhuetter_ferguson_main.js` and keep `frontend/docs/plans/bornhuetter_ferguson_method_plan.md` in sync.
2. Change BF persistence or refresh behavior: update the canonical Python BF contract, app-server BF service, frontend payload adapter, migration producer, exact parity tests, and app-server domain documentation together.
3. Change BF routing: update Project Instance dataset table, window, and message modules together.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- BF output depends on source vector/triangle period alignment; mismatched source periods can produce blank or misaligned rows.
- The persisted method label must remain `Bornhuetter Ferguson` so Project Instance and dataset dependency chips route to the BF page.
- Out-of-band source-file edits bypass the managed dependency event and require an ArcRho save or explicit repair before a BF can be refreshed automatically.
