## External Interfaces
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Cache refresh is exposed via route endpoints and service calls.
- Several caches are project-folder scoped; others are user AppData scoped.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Data/State/Caches
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- File names and limits are defined in `app_server/config.py` constants.
- `projects/<project>/data_processing_values.json` is the lazy `arcrho-source-vocab-v1` cache used by the Data Processing Rules editor. It contains de-duplicated mapped reserving-class key combinations for each source measure and is invalidated by the source CSV path/mtime/size fingerprint or a Field Mapping signature change.
- Project data is organized by reserving class as `data/<ReservingClassFolder>/datasets` for CSV caches, `data/<ReservingClassFolder>/methods` for method JSON and method RPC temp files, `data/<ReservingClassFolder>/sidecars` for dataset metadata and notes, and `data/<ReservingClassFolder>/index.json` for the Project Instance cache index. Background `WriteSidecar: false` engine requests keep per-CSV processing provenance in `data/<ReservingClassFolder>/.arcrho-cache-provenance/`; each atomic technical record includes the current processing hash and the CSV size, modification time, and SHA-256 content fingerprint, letting non-mutating Dataset/DFM/Result Selection loads reuse only the recorded file without changing the user-editable base sidecar. Dataset deletion and generated-cache clearing remove the corresponding technical record; a mismatched or replaced CSV invalidates it automatically.
- Dataset Viewer and DFM store the local last selected Project Name in `%APPDATA%\ArcRho\local_project_prefs.json` so it can be checked and edited manually without opening the server project folder. The same file also stores `recentProjectNames`, capped to the last three project names selected from the project tree picker, which appear in the picker's blue virtual `Recent Projects` folder above real project folders, and `projectExplorer.expandedFolders`, which restores the Project Settings folder expansion state.
- That file also holds `homeShortcuts`, the user's Home custom groups and shortcut cards, as `{ "version": 1, "groups": [{ "id", "title", "cards": [{ "id", "label", "target" }] }] }`. A card `target` is the same normalized descriptor `shellActivityHistory` entries use, minus the activity timestamp, so a card opens through the same restore path as Browsing History. Caps are 24 groups, 48 cards per group, and 60-character titles and labels; `ui/shell/home_shortcuts.js` owns the document schema and `scripting_preferences_service.py` validates structure and caps on save. Because `save_local_project_preferences` merges only the keys present in a request, the frequent `shellActivityHistory` writes and Home shortcut saves never overwrite each other.
- Reserving-class tree filter specs are stored in each project-user preference file under `projects/<project>/users/<windows-login>/preferences.json`; `%APPDATA%\ArcRho\cache\reserving_class_filter_spec.json` is obsolete and is no longer read or written.
- Refresh endpoints can clear and rebuild cache files.
- ResQ method imports persist the output object's review status in the dataset sidecar: vector-backed methods use `OutputVector.Status`, while Berquist-Sherman methods use `OutputTriangle.Status`. Status `2` remains Needs Review through graph refresh even when precedent timestamps are current; status `0` can still become Needs Review when ArcRho detects a newer precedent.
- ResQ migration treats `Generated=true` single-instance datasets as ArcRho Engine outputs. The migration and frontend runtime use the same canonical engine-sidecar builder; those sidecars intentionally omit ResQ labels/formulas, and `/dataset/cache/load` hydrates canonical project development headers plus the Dataset Type formula before returning the grid model.
- On an engine sidecar, `updated_at` is when the cache file was produced, while migration-written sidecars also carry `source_modified` — when the data last changed in ResQ. The import's precedent-freshness check compares `source_modified` (falling back to `updated_at`), so rewriting an unchanged dataset's cache at import time does not flip its dependent methods to Needs Review. A frontend engine regeneration removes `source_modified` because the content no longer comes from ResQ.

## Common Change Tasks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
1. Add cache file constant: update config, service readers/writers, and this index.
2. Change refresh logic: verify endpoint side effects and lock behavior.
<!-- MANUAL:END -->

## Known Risks
<!-- MANUAL:BEGIN -->
- Cache invalidation bugs can surface as stale or mismatched UI data.
- File locking can fail writes under concurrent access.
- Source-vocabulary generation must not publish a cache if the source CSV changes during its scan.
