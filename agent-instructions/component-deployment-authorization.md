# Component Deployment Authorization

Read this before rebuilding or redeploying any frozen server component. `AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` covers how to run a deploy; this file covers what each component's rebuild costs, what to verify afterwards, and how far the standing authorization reaches.

## Standing authorization

The user pre-authorizes agents to rebuild, redeploy, and relaunch any component below, including stopping that component's own running instances, whenever a task changes code it bundles. Do not request conversational confirmation for the build, deploy, stop, or relaunch; do still request any platform-required sandbox escalation.

The authorization is per component. Stopping one never authorizes stopping another, and it never authorizes stopping ResQ.

**The authorization covers only a deploy that cannot break users on the latest released app.** Every user runs the latest released desktop app, so before rebuilding decide whether that released app keeps working against the new server component. It does when the change is confined to the server side: a fix inside a job, a new job kind nothing released calls yet, a new optional field a released reader ignores. It does not when the server starts to require something the released app does not send, changes a response shape or persisted JSON the released app reads, or removes or renames a route or request kind. In that second case stop before building and tell the user explicitly what breaks and that the fix needs a frontend release, a coordinated release plus deploy, or a compatibility step; do not deploy until they answer.

## Ship impact statement (MUST, before code changes)

Before changing code for a feature or fix, state in one short block how it ships, so the user can weigh it before any work starts:

- **Frontend release only** — the change lives in `frontend/ui`, the Electron host, or app-server code that runs only inside the desktop app, and no server component bundles it.
- **Server component redeploy only** — the change lives in code bundled by Engine, Gateway, Bridge, Orchestrator, Admin Control, or Launcher (read the bundle owner named in the table below; `frontend/app_server` is bundled by the Engine and Gateway, so a hosted save or read fix is a server deploy), and the released app already sends and reads what it needs.
- **Both, in this order** — say which side must go first and why the released app is safe in between. When no order is safe, say so; the user decides how to sequence the release.
- **Risk to the released app** — "none", or the concrete request, response, or file the released app would no longer handle.

Give the same statement again in the final response when the implementation changed the answer.

## Rules that apply to every component

- **A frozen component runs its bundled copy**, so an edit to a bundled tree has no effect until that component is rebuilt. Never trust a restated bundle list — read the owner module named in the table. Many changes that look unrelated to a component still require its rebuild.
- **Rebuild once per task**, after the change is verified and before reporting the task complete — not after each edit. Skip the rebuild when a task changed only tests, docs, release fragments, or files outside every bundle, and say so.
- **Never deploy a change that has not passed its checks.**
- **A failed build leaves the deployed component untouched.** The build scripts abort rather than half-deploy: a failed build, a live instance that will not stop within the timeout, or a rolled-back swap all preserve what is deployed. Report that outcome plainly and do not retry blindly.
- **Verify after deploying** using the component's row below, and **state in the final response** which components were rebuilt, redeployed, and relaunched, or why none were.

## Components

| Component | Bundle owner to read | Stopping it costs | Verify after deploy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bridge** | `arcrho_bridge/bundled_sources.py` — `BUNDLED_SOURCES`, `CANONICAL_MODULE_ROOT`, `CANONICAL_HIDDEN_IMPORTS` | Every ResQ import blocks while it is down | The Orchestrator relaunches it only when `apps.bridge.auto_create_instance` is true — that flag has flipped before, so check it and start the deployed exe manually if it is false. Bridges are per interactive user session |
| **Engine** | `arcrho_engine/bundled_sources.py` — `ENGINE_BUNDLED_SOURCES`, plus `build_exe.py`'s `--paths` and hidden imports | Every pending calculation, dependent-propagation, and project-duplication job pauses until instances return | Fresh heartbeats under `runtime\instances\arcrho_engine\`; if the Orchestrator is not running, start `apps\ArcRho Engine\ArcRho Engine.exe` manually |
| **Gateway** | `arcrho_gateway/build_exe.py` — its `--paths` and `--hidden-import` list (it bundles `ENGINE_BUNDLED_SOURCES`) | Hosted saves fail for enrolled users; a save in flight during the swap must be retried | Fresh heartbeat under `runtime\instances\arcrho_gateway\` and `GET <client_url>/api/health` → `{"ok": true}` |
| **Orchestrator** | `arcrho_orchestrator/build_exe.py` — its imports, PyInstaller paths, and deployment logic | Component replenishment pauses; Engine, Bridge, Gateway, and ResQ keep running | Fresh heartbeat under `runtime\instances\arcrho_orchestrator\`. When the task changed its supervision of another component, verify that component's readiness signal too |
| **Admin Control** | `server-components/src/arcrho_admin/` | Local administration UI is unavailable | `GET http://127.0.0.1:28766/api/health` → `{"ok": true}` and the process is running |
| **Launcher** | `server-components/src/arcrho_launcher/` | Nothing running is affected; it owns no runtime instance | Deployed executable is stamped with the new build |

An Orchestrator deploy relaunches at least one Orchestrator. Other users' per-session Orchestrators return through their normal Launcher/login lifecycle, and their already-running Engine, Bridge, and Gateway processes are untouched.

## Admin Control needs a stop and a reopen

It is the one component the deploy cannot fully cycle on its own:

1. Shut the running server down through `POST http://127.0.0.1:28766/api/shutdown` and wait for the listener to exit. If it does not respond but the process remains, terminate only the identified `ArcRho Admin Control.exe` so the folder can be replaced.
2. Deploy it.
3. Launch `apps\ArcRho Admin Control\ArcRho Admin Control.exe` with a hidden process window so the browser UI reopens.
4. Verify health as in the table.

## Fallback: building from a client machine

When no build listener is available, running a component's own `build_exe.py` still works from a client against the server workspace over the network. It is several minutes slower per component because the frozen build crosses the share; take it only when the listener is down, and say that is what happened.

Set `ARCRHO_DEPLOY_ROOT` to the mapped or UNC ArcRho Server path. The scripts align the workspace root from it before reading any configuration and refuse a pair naming two different workspaces, so the kill switch, heartbeats, and deployed folder always belong to the same server. When the deploy root is not a local fixed disk the script does not start the deployed executable — that would run the server's component on the build machine — so clearing the kill switch is enough and the server's Orchestrator restores it. Verification is unchanged.

Do not substitute manual process termination or an in-place executable overwrite for a build script's deploy: the slot rotation, rollback, and kill-switch restore all live in that path.
