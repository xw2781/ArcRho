# Arco Excel Add-in Release Notes

Newest first. The About window opens this file from beside the add-in on the
Arco Server share.

## 4.2.1 - 2026-09-28

- Refresh Workbook shows why a refresh failed instead of stopping with a
  "Method 'StatusBar' of object '_Application' failed" error.
- Insert Function leaves an optional argument empty when you leave it blank,
  rather than writing its default, such as `=ArcoVec(D2, N18, , , 3)`.
- The About window opens these release notes.
