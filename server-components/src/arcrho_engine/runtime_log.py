"""One appender for every ArcRho Engine runtime log.

The Engine is packaged with ``--noconsole``, so a bare ``print`` is lost on
every deployed machine: whatever a job does not write here leaves no trace at
all, and a failure can only be reconstructed from file timestamps afterwards.

Logging must never change what a job does. Every error is swallowed, including
a failed rotation, so a full disk or a locked log can never fail the work the
log was only meant to describe.
