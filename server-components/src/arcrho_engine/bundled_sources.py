"""Repository sources the ArcRho Engine freezes into its executable.

The Engine runs dependent propagation through the canonical
``frontend/app_server`` services, loaded from this frozen copy rather than the
working tree, so an edit to these roots does not reach a running Engine until
it is rebuilt. ``build_exe.py`` bundles these roots and the dependent
propagation runtime resolves its ``sys.path`` from the same list, so the two
cannot drift. The mechanism (``BundledSource``) is owned by the Bridge's
bundle recipe, which this build reuses.

Keep this module free of side effects and of imports outside the standard
library plus ``arcrho_bridge.bundled_sources``.
